In the past two years, several accidents in and around Centerville have involved teenage drivers. Since a number of parents in Centerville have complained that they are too busy to teach their teenagers to drive, some othe instruction is necessary to ensure that these teenagers are safe drivers. Although there are two driving schools in Centerville, parents on a tight budget cannot afford to pay for driving instruction. Therefore an effective and mandatory program sponsored by the high school is the only solution to this serious problem Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. In the letter, the writer recommends an initiation of a high-school-sponsored driver's education course program and predicts that such a program will help solve the teenage driving problem in Centerville. While this program might be beneficial to some extent, the reasoning of this argument is unconvincing due to several unsubstantiated assumptions which, if proven unwarranted, will seriously challenge the author's recommendation. First of all, the writer's recommendation relies heavily on the assumption that the driving problem involving teenage drivers in the town of Centerville is serious enough to require immediate measures be taken. 首先，作者的建议很大程度上建立在这样一个假设上：发生在Centerville镇的青少年驾驶问题已经严重到需要立即采取行动。Based on such an assumption, the writer therefore proposes formal instruction to ensure that these teenagers become safe drivers. 基于这一假设，作者提出通过正式教学让这些青少年驾驶员学会安全驾驶。However, this assumption is potentially problematic because we are not informed with the exact number of the accidents. 然而，这一假设可能是有问题的，因为我们并不知道事故的确切数目。Nor do we know whether the teenage drivers are to blame for thee accidents. 我们同样不知道事故是否是青少年驾驶员的责任。In addition, we even have no idea whether or not the teenage drivers are local. 此外，我们甚至无法得知这些青少年驾驶员是否是本地人。If it turns out that the accidents are not sufficiently serious, or they could be attributed to factors other than the local teenage drivers' negligence, then the author's argument for a proposed driver education program is unconvincing. 如果这些事故并不那么严重，或他们并非由于本地青少年驾驶员的疏忽而导致的，那么作者提出建立驾校的项目的论点就是没有说服力的。In addition, by starting that parents have either little time or funding to provide their teenagers with driving courses, the writer rules out alternative methods which could rival the proposed driving program. 不仅如此，作者认为家长们要么没有时间，要么没有钱让他们的孩子上驾驶课程，由此排出了驾校之外的替代方案。However, we need to re-examine the assumption that the driving program is the only solution to the teenage driving problem. 然而，我们需要考察驾校项目是否是解决青少年驾驶问题的唯一方案。It is likely that the so-called busy parents just use their unavailability as an excuse because they are reluctant to teach. 那些自称很忙的家长有可能只是以此为借口掩饰他们不愿意教孩子的事实。It is of equal possibility that parent with limited budget make up only a minority of parents. 经济捉襟见肘的家长可能只是一小部分人。In addition, government-sponsored driving courses could also serve as an alternative method. 此外，由政府资助的驾驶课程也可以作为替代方案。If any of these possibilities is true, then we are inclined to believe that other solutions could overshado the one proposed to solve the driving problem. 假使真实情况符合上述任一可能性，其他的解决方案可能会让作者的建议相形见绌。Even if the assumptions mentioned above are valid, the writer's recommendation could be unnecessary due to the doubtful assumption regarding the efficiency of the proposed driving program. 即使上述假设是有根据的，若不能证明驾驶项目是有效的，你们作者的建议也可能是没必要的。Claiming that this program will be effective, the writer might be too optimistic. 作者可能对项目的有效性过于乐观了。It is unreasonable to assume that all parents, including those who would like to teach their teenagers personally, will readily accept such a school-sponsored mandatory driving instruction program. 假如所有家长，包括哪些想亲自教孩子的家长在内，都乐意接受这一学校资助的强制性驾校计划，是不合理的。Also, the writer hastily comes to the conclusion that the local high school should sponsor this program but does not discuss whether the school is financially capable of doing so. 另外，作者草率地总结本地高中应该资助这一项目，却没有讨论学校的财力是否足以承担。Furthermore, we cannot be sure that there wil be fewer accidents involving local teenage drivers after the implementation of the proposed recommendation. 此外，我们无法确定建议实施后，本地青少年驾驶员所导致的事故数量是否会减少。If this program provokes general discontent amongt parents or the school cannot afford such a program, then the recommendation may not be enacted and we cannot therefore expect a decrease in the number of driving accidents in Centerville. 如果此项目在家长中引发普遍不满或学校的财力无法承担，那么该计划将不会被推行，而我们也无法预测Centerville的事故是否会减少。To summarize, whether or not we should implement the writer's recommendation depends greatly on the validity of the assumptions in the argument. If these assumptions prove unwarranted, then the recommendation will be little more than the writer's wishful thinking, and accordingly we need to consider other solutions to the teenage driving problem in Centerville. UltraClean in Hospitals - 62The following appeared in a memo from the director of a large group of hospitals.In a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps, a concentrated solution of UltraClean produced a 40 percent greater reduction in the bacteria population than the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals. During a subsequent test of UltraClean at our hospital in Workby, that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group. Therefore, to prevent serious patient infections, we should supply UltraClean at all hand-washing stations throughout our hospital system. Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. In this memo, the author recommends supplying UltraClean to all hand-washing stations throughout the hospital system to provent serious patient infections. To support his/her suggestion, the director presents two separate studies, one conducted in a lab and the other in the field. Although UltraClean may indeed help reduce the occurrences of infections, information currently available is not conclusive because there are several unsubstantiated assumptions in the author's reasoning. The director's recommendation will be seriously challenged if these assumptions prove to be unwarranted. To start with, the laboratory study shows that a concentrated solution of UltraClean is excellent at reducing the number of bacteria. 首先，那项实验室表明UltraClean的浓缩溶液在减少细菌数量上表现出色。Based on an unstated assumption that the non-concentrated version of UltraClean is similarly effective, the director endorses the use of regular UltraClean in the hospitals. 主任基于没有言明的假设，即UltraClean的非浓缩版本有同样的功效，赞同在医院使用普通版的UltraClean。However, this assumption is potentially problematic because intuitively speaking a concentrated solution of UltraClean may naturally outperform the non-concentrated version. 然而，这个假设可能是有问题的，因为就直觉而言，UltraClean的浓缩溶液自然会优于非浓缩版本。Even if we acknowledge this assumption, UltraClean may not necessarily be as effective as the liquid hand soap currently used in the hospitals. 即使我们承认这一假设，UltraClean也不一定像目前医院使用的液体洗手皂一样有效。If this is the case, the director's assumption will not hold and his/her recommendation will be clearly weakened. 如果是这样的话，主任的假设不能成立，他的建议也将被明显削弱。Additionally, the Workby hospital field study demonstrating that UltraClean use in hospitals can reduce cases of patient infections requires further examination. 此外，我们需要进一步考察Workby医院的实地研究，该研究证明在医院使用UltraClean可以减少患者感染的病例。Whether or not UltraClean should be credited for this depends upon the assumption that Workby hospitals are comparable to those in other areas. （患者感染的减少）是否归功于UltraClean，这取决于Workby医院和其他地区的是否具有可比性。For example, if the Workby hospital is extremely small and only receives a handful of patients each day, it would not be a surprise to see fewer numbers of infections. 例如，如果Workby医院的规模很小，明天仅接收少量的患者，你们有更少数量的感染并不奇怪。Moreover, the Workby hospital may be the best-staffed one in the region, and it is their attentiveness and expertise that keeps patient infections in check. 此外，Workby医院可能是该地区与员工素质最高的医院，员工的专注和专业知识使患者感染得到了控制。For that reason, UltraClean may not necessarily be the key to few infections in the Workby hospital. 因此，UltraClean不一定是Workby医院感染数少的关键原因。As a result, the value of supplying UltraClean to other hospitals is debatable. 向其他医院提供UltraClean的建议的价值是有争议的。Even if we concede the aforementioned assumptions, the recommendation may still not be advisable because UltraClean is not shown to deal specifically with serious infections. 即使我们承认上述假设为真，该建议仍可能是不可取的，因为我们不知道UltraClean是否能专门应对严重感染。The lab and field studies focused little, if at all, on serious infections. 实验室和实地研究几乎没有关注严重感染。THe director's recommendation here essentially relies on the two assumptions: 主任的建议本质上建立在李广假设上：(1)serious infections are caused by bacteria and (2) regular and serious infections are caused by a common agent which UltraClean can effectively eliminate. 1）细菌导致严重感染；2）普通感染和严重感染都是由UltraClean可以有效消除的同一媒介物引起的。Both of these assumptions need more support. 这两个假设都需要更多的支持。It is not impossible that serious infections are drastically different in terms of its pathological nature and are caused by viruses or parasites rather than bacteria. 就病理性质而言，严重感染是截然不同的，它可能是由病毒或寄生虫而不是细菌引起的。In this case, it is very questionable if UltraClean, which only proves to be able to fight bacteria and reduce normal level of infections, can satisfactorily prevent serious patient infections. 在这种情况下，只被证明能抗菌和降低普通感染的UltraClean能否有效防止严重的患者感染是非常可疑的。To sum up, whether or not serious patient infections can be prevented by the use of UltraClean is still questionable and worth further investigation. The answer could turn out ot be positive, but only after the author can reasonably demonstrate the validity of his/her assumptions by offering more compelling evidence Homework Every Day - 137While the Department of Education in the state of Attra recommends that high school students be assigned homework every day, the data from a recent statewide survey of high school math and science teachers give us reason to question the usefulness of daily homework. In the district of Sanlee, 86 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five times a week, whereas in the district Marlee, less than 25 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five time a week. Yet the students in Marlee earn better grades overall and are less likely to be required to repeat a year of school than are the students in Sanlee. Therefore, all teachers in our high schools should assign homework no more than twice a week Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. The author of this argument casts doubt on the recommendation of the Department of Education in Attra state about daily assigned homework. Data about the frequency of homework assignments and students' academic performance in the districts of Sanlee and Marlee, serve to demonstrate daily homework's minor contribution to a decent education. The author therefore claims that students in Attra should not be assigned homework more than twice a week. However, such a conclusion cannot be readily arrived at because of several unsubstantiated assumptions. If these assumptions prove unwarranted, the argument will be seriously undermined, thus compelling us to reconsider the significant of daily homework. To start off, the author's conclusion fundamentally relies on the assumption that the frequency in assigning homework is equal to the amount of homework, or more specifically, the time students are expected to spend on homework. 首先，作者的结论基本上依赖于这一假设：留作业的频次等同于作业量的大小，或者更具体而言，学生在作业上预计要花费的时间。Even though the data reveals that a smaller number of teachers in Marlee assign homework three to five times a week, it is imprudent to assume that students in Marlee are thereby under less pressure than those in Sanlee. 虽然数据显示Marlee地区的教师很少一周布置3~5次作业，但就此假设Marlee学生所承担的压力比Sanlee学生更小是轻率的。It is highly likely that even though teachers in Marlee assign homework ess frequently, the formidable difficulty of this homework may cost students more time; 很有可能虽然Marlee的教师更少布置作业，但作业的超高难度会让学生花费更多的时间；it is of equal possibility that while students in Marlee may receive modest amounts of homework from their math and science teachers, such an amount is offset by that assigned by teachers in other subjects. 还有可能虽然Marlee的数学和科学老师给学生布置的作业更少，但这一差距却被其他科目的老师布置的更多作业所抵消。If either of the previous scenarios turns out to be true, then the assumption that students in Marlee spend less time on homework is disproved and the suggestion to assign homework less frequently is unreasonable. 如果任何上述情况为真的话，那么假设Marlee的学生花更少的时间做作业，从而认为更少布置作业的建议是不合理的。Moreover, the author unfairly assumes that students in Marlee generally excel at schoolwork based on overall better grades and less likelihood to repeat a year. 此外，作者基于更好的分数和更少的留级情况判断Marlee的学生课业表现更好的假设也是不当的。However, these two factors do not necessarily represent excellent academic performance, let alone indicate a successful education system. 这两个因素并不一定能代表优秀的学业表现，更不用说表明教育制度是否成功。If schools in Marlee and Sanlee adopt different, even distinct standards of grading their students, it is not surprising that there would be variations in students' scores. 如果Marlee和Sanlee的学校采用不甚相同甚至大相径庭的标准来给学生评分，那么学生分数的不同也就不会让我们惊讶了。Additionally, Marlee district school may be attempting to prevent their academic reputation from declining by allowing students with poor academic performance to graduate. 此外，Marlee地区的学校为了捍卫学术声誉可能会允许学业不佳的学生毕业。Both ot hers two cases serve to undermine the facts presented by the author as good indicators of students' excellence at school. 这两种情况都会削弱作者以成绩和留级作为学生消息优秀与否的指标的可信度。If either of these circumstances proves to be true,then there is reason to doubt the validity of students' academic performance in Marlee. 如果上述任一情况被证明为真，那么我们就有理由怀疑Marlee学生的学术表现。As a a result, teachers in Marlee who assign less homework are not an example that we should follow. 因此，布置更少作业的Marlee也就不是我们应当遵循的例子了。Last, the author's argument also suffers from a questionable assumption which hastily generalizes the situation of high schools in Marlee to those in Attra. 最后，作者的论点还存在一个可疑的假设，那就是他草率地将Marlee高中的情况推而广之到整个Attra州的高中。By recommending all high school teachers in Attra to follow the lead of their counterparts in Marlee, the author assumes that students in Attra share similar capabilities with those in Marlee. 通过建议Attra所有高中老师向Marlee的老师学习，作者假设Attra的学生和Marlee的学生的能力是相似的。Nevertheless, teachers should be flexible when teaching and assigning homework and may therefore adjust the amount of daily homework, as well as the frequency of giving homework in response to their students' performance in their homework. 然而，教师在授课、布置作业的量和频次时应当灵活应变，根据学生的表现进行调节。If high school students in Attra absorb knowledge at a relatively slow rate but have strong desire to achieve improvement, they might need and even ask for more homework themselves. 如果Attra的高中生吸收知识的效率相对较低但有强烈的进步愿望，他们也许会需要，甚至会主动要求更多的作业。In such a circumstance, the author's proposal to assign homework no more than twice a week is not feasible, but theoretical at best. 在这种情况下，作者提议每周布置作业不超过两次是不可行的，充其量不过是纸上谈兵。To sum up, while homework does not necessarily play a paramount role in enhancing students' academic performance, we cannot readily ignore its significance. Thus, I propose examining the aforementioned assumptions in this argument before we accept the author's recommendation. Sleep Time - 14The following appeared as part of an article in a business magazine.A recent study rating 300 male and female advertising executives according to the average number of hours they sleep per night showed an association between the amount of sleep the executives need and the success of their firms. | | Of the advertising firms studied, those whose executives reported needing no more than 6 hours of sleep per night had higher profit margins and faster growth. | | THese results suggest that if a business wants to prosper, it should hire only people who need less than 6 hours of sleep per night. Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. In the article, the author describes a study concerning the average number of sleeping hours of 300 advertising executives and the success of their firms. The study shows a connection between sleep required (6 hours per night), and higher profit margins and faster growth. The author concludes that this link is a causal relationship and further suggests that business should exclusively hire people who need less than 6 hours of sleep per night. Astonishingly stimulating as this recommendation may sound, it suffers from several questionable assumptions, which, if not justified, would negatively influence the soundness of this argument. First, when discussing the connection between the executives' sleeping hours and the financial performance of their firms, the author apparently assumes that these executives should receive most, if not all, the credit for higher profits margins and faster growth. 首先，在讨论高管的睡眠时间和他们公司的财务表现之间的联系时，作者想当然地认为更高的利润和更快的增长率都应当归功于这些高管。However, common sense informs as that any company's excellent performance derives from combined efforts of every single unit within that company. 然而，就常识而言，任何一家公司的优秀表现离不开公司里每个个体的共同努力。Although those in high positions, such as executives, may exert great influence over the company, dismissing other employee's contributions would be both unfair and unreasonable. 尽管身处高位的人，例如高管，可能会对公司产生更大的影响力，但忽视其他雇员的努力既不公平，也不合理。Therefore, while I admit that the advertising executives might play an essential role in their firm's operation, once the participation of others also proves significant to the development of the firms, the assumption would be undermined that we should ascribe the healthy performance of these firms to their advertising executives, and the conclusion of this argument is also rendered in jeopardy. 因此，虽然我承认广告公司的高管在公司经营中可能扮演着关键角色，但若其他人的参与也被证明对公司的发展十分重要，你们“广告公司的强劲表现归功于他们的高管”这一假设就会被推翻，而从这一点推导出的论点也就站不住脚了。Even if the advertising executives should be honored for their contributions to their firms' excellent financial performance, the validity of this argument may also be impaired by another dubious assumption, the one which attributes these executives' capabilities to the amount of sleep they require, namely, 6 hours per night. 即使广告公司的卓越的财务业绩得益于他们的高管，这一论点的有效性也可能被另一不确定的假设所削弱，那就是将这些高管的能力归功于题目所需要的睡眠时间，即每晚6个小时。While we acknowledge the correlation between the length of sleep staff require and their work performance, we cannot easily see hwo 6 hours is applicable to everyone to perform their best at work. 虽然我们承认员工需要的睡眠时长和他们的工作绩效之间存在联系，但并不能轻易地判定6小时的睡眠和最好的业绩之间的联系对所有人而言都是适合的。Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that arduous work tasks actually exhaust these executives that they cannot sleep longer than 6 hours; this is to say, even better performance may result if they sleep longer. 因此，我们不能排除这样的可能性：费力的工作任务让经理睡不足6个小时，使得他们精疲力尽；也就是说，如果他们睡得更长，他们本可以表现得更为出色。If this is the case, then the previous assumption is unwarranted and we should thus vote against the author's proposal to only hire those who nee less than 6 hours of sleep per night. 如果是这种情况，你们之前的假设是不合理的，我们应该反对作者关于只雇佣那些每晚所需睡眠时长短于6小时的人的建议。Even if we concede that the handsome financial performance of these films results from their executives' outstanding capacity and that this capacity is attributable to their 6-hours sleep per night, whether the author's suggestion is advisable highly depends on the soundness of the assumption that the executives performance and that of their firms can be generalized to other staff as well as to business world. 即使我们承认这些公司出色的财务表现源自他们高管的杰出能力，且这一能力是因为他们每晚只需要睡6小时，作者的提议是否可取很大程度上还取决于另一个假设的可靠性：即高管的业绩可以推而广之到其他员工，他们的公司业绩也可以推而广之到整个商业界。However, the executives' circumstances cannot be easily applied to staff who occupy different roles; likewise, it would be irrational to draw hasty generalizations based on one firm. 然而，高管的情况不能轻易代表担任其他职位的员工；同样的，基于一个公司去概况业界情况也是不合理的。If a business claims that a longer period of sleep is needed ofr both their workers' development as well as its prosperity, then the aforementioned assumption is defeated adn the author's suggestion thus becomes absurd. 如果一家企业声称他们员工的个人发展和公司的繁荣都离不开较长时间的睡眠，你们上述假设就会被推翻，而作者的建议也会显得荒谬。To draw a conclusion, while improved financial performance is always desirable, without any support, it is illogical to assume that the performance only springs from a limited amount of staffs' sleep. Also, we cannot expect the executives to bring their firms high profits on their own. Consequently while the author's suggestion appears appealing, the questionable assumptions discussed above may deprive if of its feasibility. Bicycling Safety - 41THe following appeared in a health newsletter.A ten-year nationwide study of the effectiveness of wearing a helmet while bicycling indicated that ten years ago, approximately 35 percent of all bicyclists reported wearing helmets, whereas today that number is nearly 80 percent. | | Another study, however, suggests that during the same ten-year period, the number of bicycle-related accidents has increased 200 percent. | | These results demonstrate that bicyclists feel safer because they are wearing helmets, and they take more risks as a result. | | Thus, to reduce the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents, the government should concentrate more on educating people about bicycle safety and less on encouraging or requiring bicyclists to wear helmets. Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. In the newsletter, the author suggests that the government should assign priority to bicycle safety education instead of emphasizing the necessity of waring a helmet while riding a bicycle. What underlies such a recommendation is the assumption that bicyclists feel safer because they are wearing helmets and therefore take more risks. This assumption is further supported by two more assumptions one which advocates an authentic increase in the number of people wearing helmets during the past ten years and the second which assumes more frequent bicycle-related accidents during teh same period. However, a thorough examination dis closes that these assumptions suffer from the absence of critical information and are thereby liable to be invalidated. Once proved unwarranted, these assumptions would undermine the author's conclusion and consequently nullify the proposed recommendation. TO begin with, while we are informed of the significant increase in both the percentage of bicycle-related accidents and people who claim to wear helmets, we cannot safely assume that an increasing number of people began to wear helmets, nor can we confidently claim that people have a greater tendency to take risks while bicycling. First, whether or not the number of people who report wearing helmets, both in proportion an in number, has greatly increased depends on their truthfulness. Generally speaking, when interviewed about how to ride bicycles, people may allege safety awareness, by claiming to wear a helmet, for example. If it turns out that people lied about wearing a helmet, then the assumption that more people are wearing helmets while bicycling is unwarranted. Moreover, if the 200 percent increase in bicycle-related accidents results from an increase in bicyclists, which is highly likely given the ten-year time period, or if the accidents should not be ascribed to carelessness of the bicyclists, but instead to car drivers or pedestrian, then the assumption is untenable that bicyclists tend to take more risk. As a result, the author's recommendation si rendered questionable. Even if the aforementioned assumptions remain tenable, it is worthwhile examining the soundness of another assumption that it is the helmets that led to bicyclists' likelihood to take more risks and finally result in more accidents. In this argument, the author clearly regards the increased percentages of people claiming to wear helmets and the bicycle-related accidents as a causal relationship. However, we just do not know whether the bicyclists, who are supposed to tae responsibility for the accidents, wore a helmet or not when the accidents occurred. If it was the ones who did not wear helmets while bicycling that caused the accidents, then we should not find fault with the helmets and the author's recommendation de-emphasizing the necessity of waring helmets is obviously weakened. Granted that wearing a helmet does increase a bicyclist's propensity to take risks and consequently gave rise to increasing accidents, we should still be cautious about the assumption that helmets contributed little to the protection of these bicyclists involved in the accidents; it is of equal significance that we remain alert to the assumption that educating people about bicycle safety functions well in reducing the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents. If helmets excel at teh protection of bicyclists form significant injuries, then we should maintain their use until better safety measures are found. In addition, if the education about bicycle safety turns out to be futile, then the author's proposal is undermined and we should therefore vote against such a recommendation. To summarize, while people probably should receive more professional education about bicycle safety, we cannot readily assume that they will not benefit from wearing helmets while bicycling. Also, without concrete and reliable information, it is hasty to attribute the increased number of accidents to helmets, which in this argument are assumed to be responsible for bicyclists' penchant for risky behavior. EvidenceJazz Music Club - 25The following was written as a part of an application for a small-business loan by a group of developers in the city of Monroe.A jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise. Currently, the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away; thus, the proposed new jazz club in Monroe, the C-Note, would have the local market all to itself. Plus, jazz is extremely popular in Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe's annual jazz festival last summer; several wel-known jazz musicians live in Monroe; and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly,' which airs every weeknight at 7 P.M. Finally, a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment. Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument. In this application, the developers request that a jazz music club be built in Monroe. To support their conclusion, they point out that the nearest jazz club is 64 miles away. Moreover, they use a series of evidence to demonstrate the prevalence of jazz music in Monroe. In addition, a nationwide study is cited to prove that there are a great number of typical fans inMonroe who are inclined to spend money on jazz entertainment. Although the new jazz club may finally turn out to be lucrative, close scrutiny reveals that the conclusion lacks critical support and therefore we need more evidence to help evaluate the argument. First of all, we need evidence to verify that a new jazz club in Monroe will have no difficulty attracting all of the local customers. 首先，我们需要证据来证明开在Monroe的这家新爵士乐俱乐部能够毫不费力地吸引所有的当地客户。While the author shows that the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away, no evidence serves to rule out the possibility that customers wil continue to gou out of town despite the new jazz club in Monroe. 虽然作者指出最近的爵士俱乐部也有65英里之遥，但没有证据能排除顾客即使有了新的爵士俱乐部也会继续出城的可能。Thus, additional evidence gains great significance to determine whether the out-of-town jazz club has other advantages that outweigh the distance disadvantage, for example, a pleasant environment, comfortable service, and most importantly, appealing jazz music. 因此，能证明城外的爵士俱乐部是否能压倒远距离的其他优点的证据是十分重要的，如令人愉悦的环境，让人舒适的服务，更重要的是，引人入胜的爵士乐。If new evidence shows that the out-of-town jazz club is thus equipped, then it is reasonably safe to claim that people in Monroe will still choose to go there rather than the local jazz club, and therefore the author's recommendation is weakened. 如果新的证据表明城外的爵士俱乐部装备精良，你们我们或许可以认为Monroe的人们仍然会选择去那里而不是新的爵士俱乐部，因此作者的建议就不那么靠谱了。However, if new evidence discloses an opposite situation, then the proposal in the argument is lent great support to. 然而，如果新的证据表明情况相反，那么文中的建议就会更为可信。In addition, we need more evidence to ascertain whether jazz music is extremely popular in Monroe. 此外，我们还需要更多的证据来确定在Monroe爵士乐是否针对相当受欢迎。First, although the number of people attended Monroe's annual jazz festival last summer is astonishing at first glance, exact local attendance figures will lend considerable support ot the evaluation of the aforementioned statement. 第一，虽然乍一看去年夏天参加Monroe爵士音乐节的人数非常惊人，但我们需要确切的本地出席人数来佐证上述声明。If attendance was dominated by non-locals, then the popularity of jzz in Monroe is in great doubt and the developers' conclusion is thereby rendered unconvincing. 如果大部分参加音乐节的人并不是本地人，你们爵士乐在Monroe可能并不那么受欢迎，而开发商的结论也就不那么可信了。Second, we need to know the reason why the jazz musicians chose to live in Monroe instead of elsewhere, and whether their residence benefits the vogue of local jazz music. 第二，我们需要知道为什么爵士音乐家选择在Monroe而不是其他地方定居，并且他们住在Monroe是否有益于本地爵士乐的风尚。If it turns out that they reside in Monroe simply for the agreeable environment or attractive housing prices, or that they chose Monroe as an ideal place to enjoy life after retirement, which may lead to their constant alienation from jazz, then we are unconvinced of the popularity of the local jazz music. 如果他们住在Monroe只是为了宜人的环境或者吸引力的房价，又或者他们把Monroe当作退休后享受生活的桃花源，这让他们和爵士乐疏远了，那么我们对当地爵士乐的受欢迎程度是存疑的。Third, the evaluation of the statement concerning the prevalence of jazz music in Monroe also entails evidence about the competence of Jazz Nightly not only during the weeknights, but also on weekends. 第三，在评价Monroe地区爵士与十分流行的主张时也需要考虑能证明“爵士之夜”在工作日晚上之外，在周末的竞争力的证据。If the developers can prove that this radio program has absolute popularity regardless of the time period and its opponents, then we are disposed to believe that jazz is popular in Monroe. 如果开发商能证明这一电台节目无论在任何时间段、面对任何竞争对手时都十分受欢迎，你们我们倾向于相信在Monroe地区，爵士乐确实很流行。Finally, despite the presence of all the previous evidence, an accurate evaluation of the developers' request requires additional information. 最后，在上述证据之外，我们还需要额外的信息来准确地评价开发商的要求。Specific evidence is needed to show whether the result of the nationwide study also applies to the local situation in Monroe; that is to say, whether there exist a satisfactory number of typical fans in Monroe who are willing to spend money exclusively on jazz music. 我们需要具体的证据来表明全国性的调查同样适用于Monroe的本地情况；也即是说，Monroe地区是否存在数量喜人的典型乐迷愿意在爵士乐俱乐部中一掷千金。If the answer is positive, then the reasoning of the argument is strengthened; however, if people give priority to and spend their money primarily on jazz CDs, concerts or other entertainments than they do to jazz clubs, we are reluctant to believe that the nwe jazz club will be tremendously profitable. 如果答案是肯定的，你们论点的推理就得到了强化；然而，如果人们首先把钱花在爵士乐CD、音乐会或者其他活动而不是爵士俱乐部上，我们很难相信新的爵士俱乐部能够带来巨大利润。To sum up, the evidence cited by the developers does not provide enough conclusive information to make their request convincing. As a result, we need additional evidence to better evaluate the argument. Baskets in Palea and Lithos - 1Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to heave been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a Palean baskets in Lithos, an ancient villae across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim Rive is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean. Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument. The author of this article argues that since a type of basket that is originally thought to be produced solely in the prehistoric village of Palea was found in Lithos, the purportedly Palean baskets are not uniquely Palean. To further support this argument, he/she emphasizes that as Palea and Lithos are divided by the broad and deep Brim River, the basket could not have been transported across the river. Although the presence of an alleged Palean basket in Lithos may indeed suggest that Lithos also produced similar baskets, more evidence is needed to help us evaluate the author's conclusion. Close scrutiny reveals several key conclusions in his/her argument that ;ack critical support. Firstly, evidence revealing Brim Rivers geologic past is critically needed to assist the evaluation of the author's assertion that the Brim RIver has always been deep and broad and could only have been crossed by boat. 首先，我们极为需要能揭示Brim河地质变迁的证据，来帮助评估作者的主张——Brim河一直以来都既广且深，只能坐船通过。Thus far, this assertion does not receive any support and could possibly be wrong, since Earth's geologic features could have changed over thousands of years. 到目前为止，没有任何证据支持这一主张，它可能是错的，因为地球的地貌在数千年的时间中可能已经发生了改变。A long and continuous record of river sediments may help us determine the Brim River's history. 一份长期而连续的河流沉积的记录可以帮助确定Brim河的历史。If it shows the Brim River was indeed broad nad inaccessible when civilizations in Palea nad Lithos first developed and thrived, the author's argument will be undoubtedly strengthened. 如果它表明Brim河过去也很宽，在Palea和Lithos的文明首次发展和繁荣时，它并不能轻易通过，你们作者的论点无疑就被强化了。If, however, it turns out that the Brim River was a shallow creek or even did not come to existence at all when humans first settled in this region, then we must reject the assertion that Palean basket could only have reached Lithos by boat. 然而，如果事实证明Brim河一度是条浅溪，或在人们第一次定居此地时尚不存在，那么我们就不能统一“Palea篮子只能通过穿被运到Lithos”的主张Secondly, even if we acknowledge for now that the Brim River has always been broad and deep since the human settlement in Lithos and Palea, more evidence is needed to help us evaluate whether boats were unavailable in the entire region. 第二，即使我们暂且承认Brim河自人们定居Lithos和Palea以来就既广且深，我们也需要更多的证据来帮助我们评估整个地区是否都没有船只。The author mentions that no boats were found in Palea, but gives no information regarding boats in other villages. 作者提到Palea没有发现船只，但没有提供有关其他村庄的船只信息。If new discoveries indicate that Lithos villages possessed boats, the transportation of Palean baskets by boat was possible and the Palean basket found in Lithos could indeed have been transported in this way. 如果新的发现表明Lithos村民有船，那么用船运输Palea篮子是有可能的，而在Lithos发现的Palea篮子可能正是如此被送过去的。On the contrary, new evidence revealing an absence of boats in the entire Brim River vicinity during this time would help support the conclusion that the so-called Palean baskets anr not unique to Palea. 相反，若有新的证据表明整个Brim河附近地区在这一时期都没有船，你们作者“所谓的Palea篮子并不是Palea独有”的结论就获得了支持。Finally, granted tha no boat was available to cross the Brim River, we must consider the possibility that the baskets could hae been transported indirectly on land from Palea to Lithos. 最后，即使姑且认为没有船能让人通过Brim河，我们也必须考虑篮子可以间接地经陆路从Palea运到Lithos的可能性。Yet, based on current information offered by the author it is challenging to evaluate the likelihood of such a scenario. 然而，根据作者提供的现有信息，评估这种情况的可能性存在一定挑战。If additional evidence emerges suggesting that trade was prevalent in this region and that both Lithos and Palea were actively engaged in trade, the author's argument will be weakened, since the baskets could have been merchandise that made its way from Palea to Lithos via a large trace network. 如果有额外的信息表明该地区的贸易十分普遍，且Lithos和Palea都积极参与贸易，你们作者的论点就被削弱了，因为篮子可能经由一个大型贸易网络从Palea被卖到了Lithos。On the other hand, if we have evidence such as local chronicles indicated Palea and/or Lithos societies were relatively isolated and had limited interaction with nearby prehistoric villages, then it is unlikely that Palean baskets could have arrived in Lithos. 另一方面，如果我们有如本地编年史这样的证据表明Palea和/或Lithos社会相对孤立，并且与附近的史前村庄互动有限，那么Palea篮子就不太可能被卖到Lithos。In this case, the author's conclusion is strengthened. 在这种情况下，作者的结论就得到了加强。To summarize, the evidence which the author quotes does not provide conclusive information about the origin of the baskets found in Lithos. As a consequence, we need additional information to better evaluate of the author's claim. Building a New Office - 70The following appeared in a memo from a vice president of a large, highly diversified company.Ten years ago our company had two new office buildings constructed as regional headquarters fro two regions. The building were erected by different construction companies-Alpha and Zeta. Although the two buildings had identical floor plans, the building constructed by Zeta cost 30 percent more to build. However, that building's expenses ofr maintenance last year were only half those of Alpha's. In addition, the energy consumption of the Zeta building has been lower than that of the Alpha building every year since its construction. Given these data, plus the fact that Zeta has a stable workforce with little employee turnover, we recommend using Zeta rather than Alpha for our new building project, even though Alpha's bid promises lower construction costs. Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument. In this letter, the vice president of a large company recommends using Zeta instead of Alpha for their newly proposed building project. THe vice president insists that Zeta is a better choice despite Alpha's more competitive bid because of buildings Alpha and Zeta constructed ten years previously. Although Zeta's construction costs were higher than Alpha's, its building's maintenance costs and energy consumption have been lower than those of the Alpha-constructed building. Moreover, the vice president cites Zeta's stable workforce and low turnover rate in hopes of proving Zeta's competency. Although this argument may seem quite convincing at first glance, the vice president does not conclusively justify his/her endorsement of Zeta. More evidence is needed in order to fully assess the vice president's recommendation. To begin with, more information about maintenance costs and energy consumption of the two building is needed. 首先，我们需要更多关于两栋建筑的维护成本和能耗的信息。This is because the vice president implies that the difference in maintenance costs and energy consumption is due to Zeta and Alpha's work quality. 这是因为副总裁暗示了Zeta和Alpha的工作质量造成了不同的维护成本和能耗。This could be wrong, however, because environmental factors can also affect both maintenance costs and energy consumption. 然而，这可能是是错的，因为环境因素也可能会影响维护成本和能耗。For example, the building Alpha erected may be located in a region with a cold, harsh climate and frequent extreme weather, which would result in higher maintenance costs due to weather damage and more expensive energy bills due to higher heating demands. 例如，Alpha所建的建筑可能地处寒冷恶劣的读取，时常遭遇极端天气，天气造成的损坏导致了更高的维护成本，而对暖气的更多需求导致了更高昂的电费账单。If the evidence suggests this, the vice president's argument will be considerably weakened. 如果有证据能证明这一点，那么副总裁的论点就会被大大削弱。On the other hand, if evidence indicates a close similarity between the two regions in terms of natural conditions, the vice president's comparison is more reasonable. 另一方面，如果证据表明两栋建筑所处地的自然条件非常接近，你们副总裁的比较久显得更为合理了。Even if higher maintenance costs and energy consumption are the direct result of Alpha's construction, it is unclear whether the Alpha-constructed building's total costs are higher than the building erected by Zeta. 即使是Alpha的建设直接导致了更高的维护成本和能耗，我们也不清楚Alpha所建建筑的总成本是否高于Zeta所建的建筑。By hte total cost, I refer to the sum of construction costs and subsequent operation costs. 所谓总成本指的是建筑成本好后续运营成本之和。The vice president mentions that the Zeta building's construction costs were higher so it is possible that Zeta;s building was more expensive in terms of total cost. 副总裁提到Zeta的建筑成本更高，所以就总成本而言，Zeta建筑可能更为昂贵。However, a lack of quantified information prevents detailed evaluation. 然而，缺乏量化信息让我们无法做出详细评估。We certainly need the exact construction costs and operation figures over the past ten years to determine which company actually offers a better economical solution. 无疑，我们需要确切的建筑成本和过去十年的运营数据来决定哪家公司的方案更为经济。What is more, even if the Zeta building's overall costs i lower than the Alpha building's, whether or not Zeta should win the contract remains questionable because const should not be the only factor considered. 更主要的是，即使Zeta建筑的总成本低于Alpha公司，由于成本不应当是唯一考虑的因素，我们对是否应该签约Zeta公司仍然存疑。Besides cost, factors such as building quality, safety standards and speediness of construction ought to be taken into consideration. 在成本之外，诸如建筑质量、安全标准和作业速度之类的因素也应当被考虑在内。If Zeta's building, though cheaper, is very shabby or contains high levels of toxic materials which pose a serious health threat to its inhabitants, it would be dangerous to give Zeta the project. 虽然Zeta的建筑更便宜，但如果它非常破旧或含有高剂量的有毒物质，对其居民构成了严重的健康威胁，那么让Zeta负责项目是非常危险的。On hte contrary, a report from a certified independent quality-control agency endorsing the Zeta building's overall quality would certainly boost the vice president's recommendation. 相反，若有来自经认证的独立质量控制机构的报告为Zeta建筑的整体质量背书，那么副总裁的建议就获得了大力支持。Additionally, the author mentions that Zeta has low employee turnover and thus has a more stable workforce. 此外，作者提到了Zeta的员工流动率更低，因此拥有更稳定的工作队伍。However, it is not clear whether a company's stability is equivalent to its service quality. 然而，我们并不清除一家公司工作队伍的稳定性是否等同于它的服务质量。Alpha's allegedly higher turnover rate (though this has not yet been established) could result from strong intra-company competition which results in the dismissal fo underperforming employees. 所谓Alpha更高的流动率（虽然这还没被证实）可能是因为激烈的公司的内部竞争，那些表现不佳的员工被解雇了。In this case, Zeta's superiority over Alpha is hardly proven. 在这种情况下，Zeta并不一定优于Alpha。Feedback from the two company's previous clients regarding employee performance would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of teh true quality of each company's employees. 两家公司服务过的客户对员工表现的反馈能让我们对其员工的真实素质作出更全面的评估。In conclusion, although the vice president provides some information to support his/her argument, there are still some problems with his/her lines of reasoning. Zeta may indeed be a good candidate but we cannot logically draw this conclusion based solely on the information provided by teh vice president. More evidence is needed to determine whether Alpha or Zeta should be selected as the new project's contractor. Reduce Absenteeism - 36The following report appeared in the newsletter of the West Meria Public Health Council.An innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces. | | A study reports that in nearby East Meria, where fish consumption is ver high, people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds. | | Clearly, eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent colds. | | Since colds represent the most frequently given reason for absences from school and work, we recommend the daily use of Ichthaid-a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil-as a good way to prevent colds and lower absenteeism. Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument. In this report, the author alleges the efficiency of Ichthaid-a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil-in preventing colds and further asserts the capability of Ichthaid to lower absenteeism in local schools and workplaces. To buttress his/her recommendation, the author cites a study showing high fish consumption and low doctor-visiting frequency in Meria. We are also informed that colds are the most frequently given reason for absences from local school and work. However, close scrutiny of this argument reveals a great lack of critical evidences and we are therefore unable to evaluate the conclusion. As a result, further information is needed to from a better evaluation of the author's recommendation. To start with, while the author provides information concerning the high fish consumption and less frequent medical visits for the treatment of colds in Meria, we need more evidence to demonstrate the casual relationship between the former and the latter. 首先，虽然作者告诉我们在Meria鱼的消费很大，人们找医生看感冒的频率很低，我们仍需要更多的证据来证明这两者之间存在因果关系。For example, we need to know whether high fish consumption in Meria means that people eat a large amount of fish; 例如，我们需要知道在Maria鱼的消费量更高是否意味着人们吃大量的鱼；in addition, detailed proof will be of great significance to determine whether people visit doctors infrequently because of a lower incidence of catching colds as opposed to other reasons, such as excessively hih hospital fees. 此外，我们需要更多具体的细节来证明人们更少看病是因为更少得感冒，而不是出自其它理由，例如过于昂贵的医疗费用。If new evidence shows that people do eat a massive amount of fish and catch colds less often, then fish's efficiency in preventing colds can be confirmed and the author's recommendation is thereby more convincing. 如果新的证据能够证明人们确实吃了大量的鱼并且更少得感冒，你们吃鱼对预防感冒有效这一观点可以被确认，作者的建议因此更有说服力了。In addition, although the writer claims that the most frequently given reason for absence from local school and work is colds, he/she needs to provide more evidence to validate the assertion. 此外，虽然作者声称旷工和旷课时人们最常给出的理由是感冒，她/他需要提供更多证据来证实这个主张。Since absence due to illness is widely accepted in both schools and workplaces, using colds as an excuse not to study or work is naturally a reasonable possibility. 因为学校和职场都接受因病请假，用感冒作为缺席的借口是很合乎情理的。Therefore, we need additional evidence indicating whether people asking for absence have lied about the reasons. 因此，我们需要更多证据来说明人们是否会在请假理由上说谎。If new evidence shows that colds do play as crucial role in absenteeism, the we are disposed to believe that the author's conclusion is advisable. 如果新的证据表明感冒确实引起了大量的旷工和旷课，那么我们趋向于相信作者的建议是可取的。On the contrary, if teh evidence shows us the contrary, then we remain doubtful of the recommendation given in the argument. 反之，如果证据表明事实恰恰相反，那么我们队这一建议存疑。Even if new evidence is provided to demonstrate both fish's efficiency in preventing colds as well as the contribution colds make towards local absenteeism, we need more information to show that Ichthaid is as effective, if not more, as fish in the prevention of colds. 即使新的证据证明了鱼能有效预防感冒且感冒导致了大量旷工和旷课，我们仍然需要更多的证据来证明Ichthaid在预防感冒上比直接吃鱼更有效或至少一样有效。Specifically, we need to know whether fish's ability to prevent colds originates in its oil and not in any other parts such as the bones. 具体而言，我们需要知道是否鱼油而不是鱼的其他部位，比如鱼骨，在预防感冒上发挥作用。Moreover, it would be of great help to know whether elements in fish remain functional after a series of artificial processes. 此外，鱼所含有的元素在加工之后是否仍然有效也将帮助我们评估该建议。In addition, the author would benefit from clarifying the relationship between the usage of Ichthaid and its efficiency in preventing colds. 不仅如此，通过解释清楚Ichthaid的用法和它对预防感冒的有效性也会帮助作者更好地阐述观点。If it is fish's bone instead of fish oil that prevents colds, or artificially processed medicine lags in efficiency, or overuse of Ichthaid is found to be counterproductive, then the author's conclusion is weakened and the recommendation should therefore be rejected. 如果不是鱼油而是鱼骨能预防感冒，加工将会降低该物质的有效性或过度使用Ichthaid会适得其反，那么作者的论点就会被削弱，而他/她的建议也不应该被采纳。Otherwise, it should be encouraged. 否则，作者的建议应当被采纳。To sum up, the current information available in this argument does not sufficiently substantiate that the proposed usage of Ichthaid will preclude colds in schools and workplaces and further lower local absenteeism. As a result, we need more evidence to better evaluate the writer's recommendation. Misrepresent Reading habits? - 85In a study of the reading habits of Waymarsh citizens conducted by the University of Waymarsh, most respondents said that they preferred literary classics as reading material. However, a second study conducted by teh same researchers found that the type of book most frequently checked out of each of the public libraries in Waymarsh was the mystery novel. Therefor, it can be concluded that the respondents in the first study had misrepresented their reading habits. Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument. In this argument, the author concludes that there is a discrepancy between two studies concerning the reading habits of Waymarsh citizens. In the first study, respondents exhibited a great interest in literary classics as reading material; However, the second study revealed that mystery novels were most frequently checked out in public libraries. Consequently, the writer attributes the inconsistency to a misrepresentation of reading habits by respondents in the first study. However, I remain doubtful of this conclusion and require more evidence to substantiate it. First of all, despite the presence of these two studies, we need more evidence to demonstrate their validity. 首先，尽管有这两项调查的存在，我们仍需要更多的证据来证明这两项调查的有效性。That is to say, additional evidence is required to determine whether such two studies accurately reflect readers' reading habits. 也就是说，我们需要更多证据来证明这两项调查是否如实反映了读者的阅读习惯。For the first study, the author would benefit from ruling out the possibility that the questions were biased and therefore induced the respondents to give answers in ways that did not accurately reveal their true reading habits. 就第一项调查而言，作者没有考虑到调查问题可能存在偏差，因此没能问出受访者真正的阅读习惯。More specifically, we need to know what aspects of books they assign most significance to: contents, designs of covers or prices, for example. 具体而言，我们需要知道问题中他们把图书的哪些方面排在优先级较高的位置，例如内容、封面设计、或是价格。If new evidence helps to preclude such a probability that the interviewed citizens in the first study wre biased, then the author's conclusion is strengthened; otherwise the argument is undermined. 如果新的证据能排除第一项调查的存在偏差的可能，那么作者的论断就更为可信；反之，就不那么可信。What is more, the author should provide evidence to confirm the validity of the second study. 此外，作者还需要提供证据来证明第二项调查的有效性。First, the more fact that mystery novels are most frequently checked out of the public libraries does not necessarily serve as an indicator of people's reading interests. 第一，公立图书馆中最常被借出的书是悬疑小说并不一定能表明人们的阅读兴趣所在。Thus, we need to know whether people borrowed books from public libraries for other reasons, such as assisting with school assignments. 我们需要知道人们是否因为其他理由而从图书馆借书，比如用来完成学校作业。If specific evidence shows us that reading interests did not even play a significant, if not unique, role in influencing people's checking out behavior in libraries, then the argument is weakened and the respondents in the first study were truthful. 如果特定证据表明人们在图书馆借书时，阅读兴趣并不是唯一的理由甚至不是重要的理由，那么作者的推理将不那么可信，第一项调查中的受访者则是可信的。Second, as a matter of fact, people who are fans of a certain book genre do not always need to check out those books but can instead read them in the library. 第二，喜欢某类书籍的人们并不一定要借出这些书，而可以在图书馆中阅读。If evidence proves this scenario true, then the argument is seriously questioned; in other circumstances, however, the argument is lent great support to. 如果这一猜想是正确的，那么作者的论证是十分可疑的；反之，作者的论证则得到了强化。Third, while the first study focused on Waymarsh citizens, the second study apparently narrowed its focus to those who borrowed books from the public libraries. 第三，第一项调查聚焦于Waymarsh市民，而第二项调查则缩小了范围，只包括从公立图书馆借书的人。Therefore, it is likely that people who enjoy literary classics could borrow books from private libraries or buy ones directly form bookstores. 因此，那些喜爱文学经典的人可能从私立图书馆借书或者直接从书店买书。If new evidence is provided to exclude such a possibility the I would be inclined to believe that the author's conclusion; 如果新的证据能够排除这一可能性，那么我倾向于相信作者的结论；Otherwise I remain unconvinced of the argument. 复制，我对该结论存疑。Even if the results from the two studies accurately reveal the readers' authentic reading habits and these two results are inconsistent, we need further evidence to demonstrate that this inconsistency is a direct result of respondents deliberately misrepresenting their reading habits. 即使这两项调查的结果准确地揭示了读者真实的阅读习惯而双方的结论大相径庭，我们也需要更多的证据来证明这一矛盾是由读者有意歪曲他们的阅读习惯所导致的。Since we are not informed with the length of time between the two studies, we cannot be sure that people's reading habits did not change during this period. 由于我们并不知道这两项调查之间的时间间隔，无法确定人们的阅读习惯在这段时间内没有改变。If new evidence shows that literary classics lost their dominance during this period, then the respondents in the first study were actually telling the truth when they stated that they preferred literary classics, which does not contradict the second survey's subsequent results that mystery novels were borrowed from public libraries more than literary classics were. 如果新的证据表明在这段时间内文学经典已不再是人们的最爱，那么第一项调查中的受访者表明他们偏爱文学经典并没有说谎，这和第二项调查中，相比文学经典人们更多借阅悬疑小说的结论并不构成矛盾。To draw a conclusion, we need further proof to from a better evaluation of the argument. Only after weighing all of the evidence which serve to weaken the conclusion as well as those supporting the argument, can we come to a decision about the soundness of this argument. ExplanationRelaxed Pace of Life - 92Workers in the small town of Leeville take fewer sick days than workers in the large city of Masonton, 50 miles away. Moreover, relative to population size, the diagnosis of stress-related illness is proportionally much lower in Leeville than in Masonton. According to the Leeville Chamber of Commerce, these facts can be attributed to the health benefits of the relatively relaxed pace of life in Leeville. Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanations(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument. In this argument, we are informed that workers in Leeville take fewer sick days than workers in Masonton, a large city than Leeville. Also, a smaller proportion of people in Leeville are diagnosed with stress-related illness. The Leeville Chamber of Commerce attributes these two facts to the health benefits of the relatively relaxed pace of life in Leeville. While I concede that such a lifestyle could result in a healthier physical and mental state, I maintain that other plausible explanation can also account for the facts presented in this argument. However, with only the current information, we are unable to decide which explanation is best. Nor is it utterly certain that one factor alone is responsible for the facts presented in the argument. To begin with, the Chamber of Commerce that Leeville workers take fewer sick days due to better health. 首先，商会宣称Leeville的工人因为身体更好所以更少请病假。While I admit that this might be the case, I also argue that fewer sick days taken by the local workers do not necessarily spring from a healthier state. 虽然我承认这可能是事实，但我要指出当地工人请病假更少不一定是因为他们更健康。Absence of significant information contributes to the failure to rule out the possibility that workers would still attend work even if they were seriously ill. 关键信息的缺失让我们无法排除工人是否会带病上班。More specifically, the workers' limited absence from work in Leeville may not lie in their satisfactory health conditions, but could be ascribed to a strict or even harsh working discipline. 更具体而言，Leeville的工人更少缺勤可能不是因为他们的健康状态更好，而是因为他们的工作纪律十分严格乃至过于严苛。What is of equal possibility is that Leeville's workers themselves are reluctant to take sick days, which could be explained by their extraordinary passion for jobs. 同样有可能的是Leeville的工人自身不愿意请病假，比如他们对工作抱有超凡的热情。In addition, it will be unfair to keep blind to the possible scenario wherein the comparatively smaller number of sick days taken by workers in Leeville could also derive from Leeville's sparse population of local workers. 此外，我们不能对Leeville人口更少的可能性视而不见，相对更少的员工可能是更少的病假天数的原因。All of the aforementioned explanations pose a great challenge upon, if not utterly reverse, the proposed one in the argument. 上述解释即使没有推翻作者的论点，也至少对其提出了巨大的挑战。In addition, the author ascribes a lower proportion of diagnoses of stress-related illness in Leeville to the relaxed pace of life. 此外，作者将Leeville更低的压力相关疾病的诊断比例归功于当地轻松的生活节奏。However, the proportion of diagnoses alone does not sufficiently indicate a healthier state of people in Leeville. 然而，仅靠诊断比例并不能充分说明Leeville人生活得更加健康。The lower proportion could also be explained by unsatisfactory medical resources in Leeville, both in terms of the number of hospitals and the capabilities of local doctors. 更低的诊断比例可能是由于Leeville不尽人意的医疗资源所造成的，包括医院数量和医生的水平。If this is this case, then the relaxed pace of life in Leeville is less responsible, if at all, for local people's excellent health, since Leeville citizens could be suffering from a variety of diseases, which have been neither diagnosed nor treated. 如果是这种情况，Leeville轻松的生活节奏不一定能促进本地人的健康，因为Leeville市民可能患有各种疾病，这些疾病既没有被诊断出也没有获得治疗。Even if workers in Leeville are indeed healthier than workers in Masonton, it is doubtful that the relaxed pace of life is the only factor responsible. 即使Leeville的工人比Masonton的工人更健康，轻松的生活节奏能否是唯一的原因也是存疑的。Generally speaking, good physical and mental states stem from a variety of factors: appealing environment, pleasant social relationships, and healthy diets, to name a few. 一般来说，良好的身心健康取决于多种因素——仅举激励，吸引人的环境、愉快的社会关系、健康的饮食。While we cannot assert that these factors are present and lead directly to local people's good health, we are confident that these explanations could rival the one proposed in the argument. 虽然外面无法断言这些因素都存在并直接提高了当地人的健康质量，至少这些理由可以和文中提到的解释一较高下。To summarize, although it is reasonable to believe that a relaxed lifestyle contributes to better health in Leeville, there are several alternative explanations that could challenge the author;s one and can also plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument. However, it is unreasonable to draw hasty conclusions about which explanations is best until further examination concerning Leeville town is performed. Rest Time and Safety - 104The following appeared in a memo from a vice president of a manufacturing company.During the past year, workers at our newly opened factory reported 30 percent more on-the-job accidents than workers at nearby Panoply Industries. | | Panoply produces products very similar to those produced at our factory, but its work shifts are one hour shorter thant ours. | | Experts say that fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers are significant contributing factors in many on-the-job accidents. | | Panoply's superior safety record can therefore be attributed to its shorter work shifts, which allow its employees to get adequate amounts of rest. Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanations(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument. In the memo, the vice president describes the coincidence between a higher rate of on-the-job accidents at his/her factory and a shorter work shift at nearby Panoply Industries. The vice presidents further ascribes the lower number of accidents to the shorter work time. While this might be the case, we cannot easily ignore other explanations which could rival the proposed one endorsed by the vice president. To begin with, while we could readily attribute the lower rate of on-the-job accidents at Panoply Industries to a higher level of safety, this is not the only explanation. 首先，尽管我们可以轻易地将Panoply工业公司较低的操作事故率归因于他们更高的生产安全性，但这并不是唯一的解释。Since we do not know the total number of workers at Panoply, we cannot rule out the possibility that a smaller number of employees at Panoply contribute to its comparatively lower rate of accidents. 因为我们并不知道在Panoply工作的工人数目，因此无法排除更少的员工导致相对更低的事故率这样的可能。In addition, we should be cautious of the word report, which is highly subjective and relies heavily on the kinds of accidents reported. 此外，我们也应谨慎对待“报告”这个词，这是一个非常主观的词，并且很大程度上依赖于哪些事故种类被选择“报告”。Therefore, the lower rate of accidents at Panoply could hav resulted from Panoply concealing accidents or could be due to different accidents-reporting standards. 因此，Panoply更低的事故率可能是因为他们隐瞒了事故或采集了不同的标准来决定是否报告事故。Either of these two explanations, once proves true, could easily compete the one proposed by the vice president. 若这两种解释中的任何一种为真，那么副总裁所提出的解释便站不住脚了。Even if Panoply is safer than the vice president's factory, it is hasty to attribute this safety solely to its shorter work shifts. 即使Panoply比副总裁所在的工厂更为安全，我们也不能轻易地认为是更短的轮岗时间提高了生产的安全性。Generally speaking, a safe working environment originates in a variety of factors: well-experienced employees, advanced and easily operated devices, and scrupulous supervision, any of which could exert a positive influence upon the improvement of safety level of working conditions at Panoply. 一般而言，工作环境是否安全取决于多种因素：经验丰富的员工、先进且易于操作的设备、严格的监督——其中任何一个都可能提高了Panoply的工作环境的安全水平。Without further information, we cannot unhesitatingly preclude the possibility that Panoply's safe environment stems from any of the aforementioned factors, or a combination of these factors. 在没有进一步的信息前，我们不能完全排除Panoply安全的生产环境是由上述一个或几个因素促成的。Thereby it is ill-conceived to solely credit Panoply's safe working conditions to shorter shifts. 因此单纯把Panoply安全的生产环境归功于更短的轮岗时间有欠考虑。Granted that no other factors contribute to the safe environment at Panoply, the causal relationship between shorter work shifts and fewer accidents is open to doubt. 即使我们假定并没有其他因素促成Panoply安全的生产环境，更短的轮岗时间和更少的事故数的因果关系也是存疑的。In this memo, citing the experts' words, the vice president implies that in his/her factory, it is the insufficient sleep, which derives from more accidents 在这份备忘录中，副总裁援引了专家的话，认为在他/她的工厂中，较长的轮岗时间让工人睡眠不足，由此导致的疲劳和缺乏睡眠引发了更多的事故。However, even if the experts' words are trustworthy, it is likely that even if the work shifts were shortened, workers at the vice president's factory would spend the time doing other things rather than sleeping. 然而，即使专家的话是可信的，尽管缩短了轮岗时间，工人们有可能不会花时间睡觉，而是做其他事。Consequently they will not be energetic and the high rate of accidents wil remain unchanged. 因此他们不会变得精力充沛，而事故率也将居高不下。Likewise, it is of equal possibility that workers at Panoply do not spend their free time sleeping and accordingly suffer fatigue and sleep deprivation as much as workers in the vice president's factory do. 同样的，Panoply的工人可能也没有把时间用来睡觉，和该副总裁工厂的工人们一样疲劳且缺乏睡眠。That is to say, the larger number of accidents in the vice president's factory could have resulted from workers' off-work activities. 也就是说，该工厂的事故可能是因为工人们下班后的活动所导致的。I therefore reserve my approval of the vice president's claim which attributes the lower rate of accidents to shorter work shifts. 因此，我对副总裁的看法，即较短的轮岗时间降低事故率，持保留意见。To summarize, while a shorter work shift may plausibly account for a lower rate of on-the-job accidents. I remain open to different explanations that also help to illustrate the facts presented in this argument. Unless the vice president offers clarification, I remain doubtful that his/her explanation is only possibility. The Extinction of the Mammal Species - 165Humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands about 7,000 years ago, and within 3,000 years most of the large mammal species that had lived in the forests of the Kaliko Islands were extinct. Previous archaeological findings have suggested that early humans generally relied on both fishing and hunting for food; since archaeologists have discovered numerous sites in the Kaliko Islands where the bones of fish wre discarded. it is likely that the humans also hunted the mammals. Furthermore, researchers have uncovered simple tools, such as stone knives, that could be used for hunting. The only clear explanation is that humans caused the extinction of the various mammal species through excessive hunting. Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanations(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument. In the argument, we are informed that humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands around 7,000 years ago and that these inhabitants witnessed the ensuing extinction of large mammals species in the forests of the Islands within the subsequent 3000 years. Referring to archaeological discoveries, such as fish bones, as well as simple tools like stone knives, the author ascribes the extinction of the various mammal species to excessive human hunting. Reasonable though this explanation might appear, we cannot safely claim that it is the only ine that can reasonably account for the facts presented in the argument. Therefore, we must thoroughly consider the following explanations, which rival the proposed one in the argument. To begin with, the writer attributes the discovery of fish bones to humans fishing in the Kaliko Islands. 首先，作者将鱼骨的发现归因于Kaliko岛上人类的捕鱼活动。While human fishing might well have resulted in the fish bone remains, the latter could have also sprung from other factors. 虽然人类的捕鱼活动会残留下鱼骨，但鱼骨的出现也可能出自其他因素。First of all, it is likely that the unearthed fish bones trace back to a period when human habitation was scarce, or non-existent. 第一，这些地下鱼骨可能上溯到人类还很少或根本还没来的时期。If this is the case, then human behaviors had little to do with te fish bone remains and teh subsequent mammal extinction. 如果是这样的的话，那么人类的行为和鱼骨的残骸以及之后的哺乳动物的灭绝就是无关的。Consequently, the fish bones can be explained as stemming from the fish's natural death and eventual deposit ont he sites later discovered. 因此，鱼骨残骸可能是由于鱼群的自然死亡并沉积在之后发现的遗址上所造成的。Second, even if human occupancy in the Kaliko Islands does correspond with the fish habitation, the fish bones cannot be exclusively attributed to human fishing. 第二，即使当时已有大量人类在Kaliko岛上居住，也不能将鱼骨完全归因于人类的捕鱼活动。Instead, it is of equal likelihood that other animals also caught and ate fish and thus contributed to the disappearance of various mammals in the Kaliko Islands. 相反，其他动物同样有可能捕食鱼类并导致Kaliko岛上各种哺乳动物的消失。Once tha assertion that Kaliko people relied on fishing proves unwarranted, the underlying logic would be weakened, namely; 只要Kaliko人依赖捕鱼为生这一断论被证明是站不住脚的，作者得出结论的潜在逻辑也就被削弱了，即if Kaliko relied on fishing, they must also have had a dependence on hunting the mammals. 如果Kaliko人依赖捕鱼为生，他们也会狩猎哺乳动物。In addition, the uncovered simple tools, including stone knives, lend great support to the arguer's explanation that the annihilation of mammal species arises from human hunting. 此外，发现包括石刀在内的简单工具支持了作者的观点——人类的狩猎活动导致哺乳动物的灭绝。However, those tools might not have necessarily been used for the stated purpose, but presumably for other reasons as well. 然而，这些工具未必如作者声称的那样用于捕猎，而可能有其他用途。For instance, humans living in the Kaliko Islands could have used those tools to document what they had passed through day in and day out or those tools could have been made for aesthetic purposes. 例如，居住在Kaliko的人类用这些工具来计算时日或作为装饰。Moreover, people could also have used those tools to protect themselves from animal attacks. 此外，人们还可能用这些工具来保护自己免受动物攻击。Without further examination, we cannot decide which explanation finally led to the discovery of such tools. 在没有进一步考察之前，我们无法判定这些工具的用途。It is even likely that all the aforementioned factors might have conspired to the finding of those tools. 甚至，有可能这些工具包含了上述所有的用途。Finally, even if we admit that the uncovered fish bones and those simple tools were used by humans to hunt mammals on the Kaliko Islands, it is reckless to claim that human hunting has reached such an excessive degree that it directly contribute to the extermination of mammals. 最后，即使我们承认被发现的鱼骨和简单工具是Kaliko人用来狩猎哺乳动物的，我们也不能轻率地声称人类的狩猎肆意到直接导致了哺乳动物的灭绝。Other explanations could readily rival the alleged one in the argument. 除了文中提到的观点，还有其他合理的解释。Considerable climate change, which went beyond mammals' adaptation abilities, the vanishing of food resources on which those mammals relied, or attack by other animals are all possible factors that could have triggered or accelerated the mammal extinction in the Kaliko Islands. 剧烈的气候变化超出了哺乳动物的适应能力、哺乳动物赖以生存的事物来源的消失、其他动物的攻击，这些都可能导致或加速Kaliko岛上哺乳动物的灭绝。To draw a conclusion, although human behavior could have exerted negative influence on nature in the absence of sufficient information, we cannot establish a casual relationship between it and waning of other animal species. The extinction of mammals in the Kaliko Islands is such a case which requires more considerations of alternative explanations that could account for the facts presented in the argument. Questionthe Retail Sale of Home Heating Oil - 150The following appeared in a letter from a firm providing investment advice to a client.Homes in the northeastern United States, where winters are typically cold, have traditionally used oil as their major fuel for heating. | | Last year that region experienced 90 days with below-average temperatures, and climate forecasters at Waymarsh University predict that this weather pattern will continue for several more years. | | Furthermore, many new homes have been built in this region during the past year. | | Because these developments will certainly result in an increased demand for heating oil, we recommend investment in Consolidated Industries, one of whose major business operations is the retail sale of home heating oil. Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation. In this letter to potential investors, the author recommends investment in Consolidated Industries, one of whose major business operations is residential heating oil, because of the anticipated greater demand of heating oil. To support his/her claim, the author quotes the climate forecast indicating continuing harsh winter weather as well as the increasing number of houses being built in this region. Quite convincing though his/her argument may seem at first glance, there are a number of questions regarding his/her lines of reasoning that requires further analysis. THe argument could end up being pretty convincing or invalid in the end, depending on the answers in those questions. To begin with, the author's reasoning relies heavily on the accuracy of the climate forecaster, a question that is not answered. 首先，作者的推理在很大程度上依赖于气候预报的准确性，但我们并不知道这个问题的答案。It is possible that the predictions about future climate are completely wrong, because the Earth's climate system is highly complex and can change rather unpredictably. 对于未来天气的预测很有可能是完全错误的，因为地球的气候系统高度复杂，且变幻莫测。Without additional information to evaluate future climate and winter weather conditions, it is possible that the northeastern United States could actually experience warmer winters. 我们没有额外的信息来评估未来的天气和冬季气候条件，有可能美国东北部正经历暖冬。THis scenario would seriously challenge the predicated increase in oil demand, and render the author's recommendation much less advisable. 这种情况将严重挑战对石油需求增长的预测，并使得作者的建议并不那么可取。On the other hand, any valid proof that the forecast is well founded will strengthen the author;s argument. 另一方面，任何有效的，能证明预测是有根据的证据则会加强作者的论点。Grated that future climate will be extremely cold and given the fact that new houses are being built in this region, whether or not oil demand will increase in response to colder winters and increasing population needs a second look. 姑且认为未来气候将极端寒冷并鉴于该地区正在建造新房屋，我们需要再次考察更寒冷的天气和增长的人口是否会导致石油需求的增长。Behind the author's argument lie two critical implied assertions. 作者的论点背后暗含着两个重要的主张。The first one is that people will spend their winter in this very region, which could be wrong. 第一，人们会在此地度过冬天，这可能是错误的。The possibility that people would migrate to warmer areas, such as the southeastern United States, during the winter to escape from the bitter cold must be considered and addressed. 我们必须考虑到并指出人们可能会在冬天迁徙到更温暖的地方，诸如美国东南部，来躲避严寒。Yet, if the author can provide information to unequivocally demonstrate that a substantial number of people live in the northeast during the winter his/her conclusion will hae weight. 然而，如果作者能够提供信息，明确证明相当数量的居民会在冬天仍会住在东北部，那么我们应当重视作者的结论。Furthermore, the second assertion is that oil will remain the major fuel for heating in the future. 此外，第二个主张是石油任然会是未来供暖的主要燃料。Although in the past people have traditionally used oil for residential heating, the possibility that new heating methods may emerge cannot be excluded. 虽然在过去，人们传统上将石油用于住宅供暖，但我们不能排除出现新的取暖方法。For example, residential heating powered by nuclear or solar energy may enter the market and begin to compete with traditional fossil fuels. 例如，有核能或太阳能供电的宅用暖气可能会进入市场并同传统的化石燃料展开竞争。We have no clue if the dominance of oil in energy market will still persist. 我们不知道石油是否能够继续在能源市场上占据统治地位。If no, the demand for oil is unlikely ot increase despite the fact that there is indeed a huge demand for residential heating. 如果不是这样的话，尽管对住宅供暖有大量的需求，但该地对石油的需求未必会增加。On the other hand, increased oil demand can be expected from a continued heavy reliance on oil, creating favorable market conditions for Consolidated. 另一方面，如果人们依然严重依赖石油，那么对石油的需求的增长是可预期的，这位Consolidated公司创造了有利的市场条件。Finally, even if we acknowledge for a moment that oil demand does rise in response to harsh weather and population growth, it remains to be seen whether Consolidated industries can capitalize on this as the author assumes. 最后，即使我们暂且承认严酷的天气和增长的人口会带来石油需求的增长，我们仍然需要考察Consolidated公司是否能如作者所言借此获利。Other factors, such as management efficiency and local competitions could potentially affect Consolidated's financial performance. 诸如管理效率、本地竞争等其他因素可能会潜在影响Consolidated的财务表现。If, for instance, Consolidated is poorly managed and there is widespread corruption within corporation, it is doubtful that Consolidated will be hugely profitable and worth investment. 例如，如果Consolidated管理不善，内部腐败丛生，你们Consolidated是否会获得巨大利润、是否值得投资，都是存疑的。To sum up, although a cold, harsh climate and a rising population have the potential to elevate the demand for heating oil, this is not a conclusion that can be derived from the information available in this argument. Furthermore, even if oil demand does rise, the investment recommendation is built upon a shaky assertion, which is still open to different possibilities. Only after those questions are adequately addressed can we effectively evaluate the author's argument and reach a logically sound conclusion. Profits Increase - 35The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment complex to its manager.One month ago, all the showerheads in the first three buildings of the Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to one-third of what it used to be. | | Although actual readings of water usage before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation must pay for water each month. | | Except for a few complaints about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. | | I predict that modifying showerheads to restrict water flow throughout all twelve buildings in the Sunnyside Towers complex will increase our profits even more dramatically. Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation. In the letter, the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment complex predicts a dramatic profit increase for Sunnyside Corporation. His/her prediction relies heavily on the seemingly pleasing results from showerhead modification in the first three building of the Sunnyside Towers complex. In those buildings, the maximum water flow has been restricted to one-third of what it used to be. While reducing the amount of shower water might be desirable both environmentally and financially, whether he author's prediction is reasonable hinges on the answers to the following questions. The first series of questions I am going to put forward revolve around the actual consequences brought about by modifying the maximum water flow. 首先我要对改造最大水流量的实际成果提问。More specifically, I need to ask what the exact water usage readings are before and after the adjustment. 更具体而言，我需要知道调整前和调整后确切的用水量读数。Will people take longer showers now that the water flowers is restricted? 现在水流变小了，人们会花更长的时间来洗澡吗？If the answer to this questions is positive, then a decrease in water usage is not safely guaranteed and therefore the writer's final prediction is open to doubt. 如果回答是肯定的，那么我们并不能保证用水量会减少，而作者的最终预测也会受到质疑。On the contrary, if it turns out to be the other way around, then the prediction is strengthened instead. 相反，如果答案是否定的，那么作者的预测就显得更可信了。In addition, while the arguer claims that few problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment, it is still a question whether one-month period of time is too short for all problems to have emerged; 此外，尽管作者声称在改造之后只收到了个别投诉，但一个月的时间还不足以暴露出所有问题；have any problems or complaints been concealed or even suppressed? 住客的投诉是否被隐藏或压制了呢？If the answer to either of these two questions is yes, then the argument's prediction is undermined; otherwise it is shored up. 如果这两个问题的答案有一个是肯定的话，那么作者的预测就会被推翻；反之，他/她的预测就更可信了。Witnessing the seemingly positive result of the showerhead adaptation, the author further recommends a wider application of the adaptation to all the twelve buildings in the Sunnyside Towers complex. 在看到淋浴头改造看似喜人的成果后，作者进一步建议对向阳塔的12座公寓大楼都就行改造。However, before reaching that conclusion, we need to know whether such a generalization is hasty. 然而，在得出这一结论之前，我们需要知道这样的推而广之是否是草率的。The current fow complaints might derive from the possibility that people who wer not satisfied with the adaptation in the first three buildings went elsewhere for shower. 有可能前三栋楼里的人去了其他楼里洗澡，所以公寓方才没有收到太多投诉。Therefore, we need to ask whether it is possible that once we implement the author's proposal and modify all the showerheads throughout all twelve buildings in the Sunnyside Towers complex, is the corporation going to lose the customers? 因此，我们需要问，一旦采纳了作者的建议在12栋楼里都改造了淋浴头，公司会不会损失他们的客户？If it will unfortunately suffer from a great loss of customers, then the prediction in the argument is unreasonable; in other circumstances it is not. 如果公司会因为大量的改造失去了客户而蒙受损失，那么作者的建议是不合理的；在其他情况下，则可能是合理的。Even if people accept the showerhead modifications, whether such modification surely leads to a growth in profits remains an unanswered question. 即使人们接受改造淋浴头，我们仍然不知道改造计划是否会带来利润的增长。While we a re informed that the corporation pays for water each month and therefore the water fee may decline due to the showerhead adjustments, we have no information concerning the modification expenses. 我们知道公司每月付水费，因此改造淋浴头后水费会降低，但我们不知道公司为改造淋浴头要花多少钱。Simply speaking, how od the saving resulting form the adjustments compare to the expense of adjusting them? 简单来说，改造所节省的水费和改造本身的费用孰多孰少？If the savings are sight, then we cannot expect profits to rise and the author's recommendation should therefore be rejected, but if the savings are significant, then the proposal should be encouraged. 如果节省的费用是很少的，你们我们不能指望利润将会有所上升，而作者的建议也不会被采纳；但如果能节省的水费是十分可观的，那么作者的建议应该被采纳。While I sympathize with the author's intention to reduce costs, whether we should resort to showerhead modification in all the buildings is subject to more consideration. We especially need to know how people react to the modifications, the adjustment expenses, and the potential savings as a result of the modifications. Abandon Tradition - 74The president of Grove College has recommended that the college abandon its century-old tradition of all-female education and begin admitting men. Pointing to other all-female colleges that experienced an increase in applications after adopting coeducation, the president argues that coeducation would lead to a significant increase in applications and enrollment. However, the director of the alumnae association opposes the plan. Arguing that all-female education is essential to the very identity of the college, the director cites annual surveys of incoming students in which these students say that the school's all-female status was the primary reason they selected Grove. The director also points to a survey of Grove alumnae in which a majority of respondents strongly favored keeping the college all female. Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation. In this argument, a debate is presented between the president of Grove College and the director of alumnae association regarding abandonment of the college's century-old tradition of all-female education. Supporting this recommendation, the president cites other all-female colleges that adopted a similar education system and witnessed a subsequent increase in applications. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the director of the alumnae association who oppose the plan. Citing opinions of Grove's incoming students and alumnae, both of whom endorse preserving the all-female tradition, the director argues that such a tradition is an essential college identity. Plausible as both sides of this debate may appear, in order to decide which recommendation is most reasonable, we need to ask more questions and the answers to these questions might help us settle on the ultimate decision. To begin with, we need to raise a series of questions and the answers to these questions might contribute to confirming the causal relationship between the coeducation system and the increase in applications. 首先，我们需要提出几个问题，这几个问题的答案能帮助我们确认男女同校的教育制度和申请数增长之间是否存在因果关系。Firstly, even though we are informed that adoption of the coeducation system was followed by an increase in applications in some all-female colleges, we may still wonder whether such an increase could occur in this case. 第一，即使我们被告知在男女同校后，一些女子学校的申请数获得了增长，我们仍然需要知道这样的增长是否也会发生在Grove。Normally, an application increase might spring from various factors, such as excellent faculty with strong academic backgrounds, and appealing campus, for example, and in most cases those factors conspire to influence whether students decide to apply. 通常而言，许多因素可能导致申请数的增长，比如有较强学术背景的优秀教师、引人入胜的校园；在大多数情况下，这些因素会共同作用，影响学生是否决定申请。Therefore, unless the president gives a positive answer showing that adoption of the coeducation system is the only reason responsible for the applications increase, we remain unconvinced of such a system's efficiency in attracting students. 因此，除非校长能够给出肯定的回答，表明采用男女同校是导致申请增长的唯一原因，我们队男女同校能够有效吸引学生这一观点只能存疑。Secondly, even if the aforementioned causal relationship is confirmed, we need to question whether Grove College will experience a similar application increase by adopting the coeducation system. 第二，即使我们确认了上述因果关系，我们还需质疑Grove学院采取男女同校后收到的申请是否会有相似的增长。This question further behooves us to inquire the extent to which Grove College is analogical to other all-female colleges mentioned in the argument. 该问题进一步要求我们就Grove学院和文中提到的其他女校的相似程度提出疑问。If the president provides answers to demonstrate sufficient similarities between those colleges and Grove College, then we are inclined to accept his/her recommendation/ 如果校长能够证明Grove和其他学校之间足够相似，那么我们趋向于接受他/她的建议。Otherwise we reserve our approval. 否则我们将保留意见。Similarly, we should also carefully ponder the director's assertion. 同样的，我们也需要仔细考虑校友会主任的观点。Although the director shows us the incoming students' ardor for Grovel College's all-female status, we need to know how other students view such a status, since they may contribute to future application increase. 虽然主任表明了新生喜爱Grove的全女子教育，我们需要知道其他学生如何看待这一情况，因为这些人可能有助于在未来提高申请数。If these potential students exhibit great interest in studying at Grovel even without the all-female status, then we should reconsider the director's claim and maybe initiate the coeducational system. 如果这些潜在的学生在全女子教育之外也对Grove表现出极大的热情，那么我们就需要再次斟酌主任的言论、并可能会开始实行男女同校。Likewise, what we also need to know is whether the respondents of the alumnae survey stand representative. 同样的，我们还需要知道校友会调查的受访者是否具有代表性。Since the survey may have been biased in terms of its design, we need to ask whether only those who favor the all-female education responded to the survey. 由于调查可能在设计方面存在偏差，我们需要质疑是否只有那些喜欢全女子教育的人回复了调查。A positive answer to this questions renders the director's claim less convincing and a negative one lends it more credibility. 如果答案是肯定的，主任的主张就不那么可信；而如果答案是否定的，主任的主张就更为可信。Finally, even if the president's and the director's assertions are sufficiently supported by authentic facts, in order to make a reasonable recommendation concerning the admission system of Grovel College, it is of great significance to take into consideration aspects other than application rate and college identity. 最后，即使事实充分支持了校长和主任的主张，为了对Grove的录取制度提出合理的建议，考虑申请率和大学认同感之外的方面也是十分重要的。If extra factors, such as college reputation, matters as much as or more than the aforementioned two factors, then we should give second thought to the two speakers' recommendation. 如果其余因素，例如学校声誉，和上述两个因素同样重要或更为重要，我们就需要再次考虑两位发言者的建议了。To sum up, despite the passionate proposals put forward by the president and director, as well as the respective reason they give, we should defer our conclusion about which is superior until the questions discussed above are carefully examined. The Old Dairy - 76The following appeared in a newsletter offering advice to investors.Over 80 percent of the respondents to a recent survey indicated a desire to reduce their intake of foods containing fats and cholesterol, and today low-fat products abound in many food stores. | | Since many of the food products currently marketed by Old Dairy Industries are high in fat and cholesterol, the company's sales are likely to diminish greatly and company profits will no doubt decrease. | | We therefore advise Old Dairy stockholders to sell their shares, and other investors not to purchase stock in this company. Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation. In this newsletter, the author advises Old Dairy stockholders to sell their shares and other investors not to purchase stock in this company. To strengthen his/her recommendation, the author cites a recent survey, which indicated more than 80 percent of the respondents' desire to abstain from foods containing fats and cholesterol. In addition, the abundance of current low-fat products in many food stores, as well as the great number of Old Dairy's high-fat and high-cholesterol products, are also given to support the predicted diminished sales and decreased profits of the company. However, before we reach a final decision about whether or not this advice is reasonable, we first need to raise several questions, and the answers these questions would help us assess this proposal. First of all, despite the survey indicating most respondents' desire to refrain from foods containing fats and cholesterol, we need to know whether this desire would directly lead to a decrease in the products of Old Dairy Industries. 首先，尽管调查显示大多数受访者希望避免摄入含脂肪和胆固醇的食物，我们需要知道这种想法是否真的会减少OD产品的销售额。Specifically, we need to ask: are the respondents swayed by other factors when selecting foods, such as flavor or price? 具体而言，我们需要问：受访者在挑选食物时是否还会受到其他因素如口味或价格的影响？Also, are the respondents able to distinguish the foods containing fats and cholesterol from those that do not? 此外，受访者们是否能够甄别不含脂肪和胆固醇的食物？If flavor and price do influence the respondents' purchase behavior more than nutritional elements do; or if the respondents cannot tell difference between high-fact and high-cholesterol foods and other foods, a definite decline in high-fat and high-cholesterol foods of Old Dairy would not be guaranteed, and the author's suggestion is undermined. 如果口味和价格比营养元素对受访者的影响更大，或受访者无法甄别高脂、高胆固醇的事物，那么我们不能保证OD高脂、高胆固醇产品的销量将会显著降低，而作者的建议也就不那么合理了。Otherwise, the conclusion of the argument may be verified and the advice is reasonable. 若答案是肯定的，那么作者的结论将被证实，而他/她的建议也是合理的。Secondly, even though the author informs us that many food products currently marketed by Old Dairy Industries are high in fat and cholesterol, he/she would benefit from clarifying the question what fraction do these products comprise of all foods produced by Old Dairy Industries? 其次，尽管作者告诉我们OD目前销售的许多产品都是高脂、高胆固醇的，阐明这一问题对他/她的论点不无裨益：这些食物在OD生产的所有食品中占多少比例？Or, more specifically, does Old Dairy Industries also produce low-fat and low-cholesterol foods? 更具体而言，OD是否也生产低脂、低胆固醇的食品？If the answer is yes, then even if the foods containing high fats and cholesterol might suffer from a decline in sales, this decline could probable be offset by an increase in sales of the company's low-fat nad low-cholesterol products. 如果回答是肯定的，那么即使高脂、高胆固醇食品的销量会下降，这部分的损失也可以被增长的低脂、低胆固醇食品的销量抵消。As a result, the company's overall sales would not witness a decrease and neither would their profits. 因此，公司的整体销售额和利润未必会下降。However, if Old Dairy Industries relies heavily on sales of high-fat and high-cholesterol foot, then the company is subjected to a significant decrease in both sales and profits. 然而，如果OD极为依赖于销售高脂、高胆固醇食品，那么公司的销售额和利润就会大幅下降。Finally, granted that low-fat and low-cholesterol foods may come to dominate the food market and Old Dairy Industries mainly products foods with high fats and high cholesterol, before deciding whether Old Dairy Industries is worth investing in, we need to know the company's intent. 最后，即使我们姑且认为低脂、低胆固醇食品将会主导食品市场且OD主要生产高脂、高胆固醇食品，在决定OD是否值得投资前，我们还需要知道公司的打算。That is to say, we need to ask: will the company change its strategy and main products in the future? 也就是说，公司将来会改变它的战略和主打产品吗？If Old Dairy is flexible in its strategy and can therefore efficiently exchange its products in order to appeal to those favoring low-fat and low-cholesterol foods, we may advise stockholders against selling shares and the persuade other to invest. 如果OD采用灵活的战略，能够有效改变它的产品以吸引喜欢低脂、低胆固醇食品的顾客，我们也不会建议股东出售股票并建议其他人进行投资。If the opposite is true, then we may encourage Old Dairy stockholders to sell their shares, and at the same time deter others investors from purchasing stock in this company. 如果事实恰恰相反，那么我们可能会建议OD的股东出售股票，同时让其他投资人打消购买OD股票的想法。To sum up, although the financial market fluctuates greatly, we should not make hasty decisions in response to every erratic market change. In order to decide whether the recommendation in the argument is reasonable, we need to ask the aforementioned questions and the answers to the questions would contribute to a better evaluation of the proposal.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Python Web 服务器网关接口（原文附译文）原文地址：PEP-3333译文项目：Preface for Readers of PEP 333(致PEP333读者的前言)This is an updated version of PEP 333, modified slightly to improve usability under Python 3, and to incorporate several long-standing de facto amendments to the WSGI protocol. (Its code samples have also been ported to Python 3.) 本文档是PEP333的升级版，针对Python3进行了可用性方面的细微修改，采纳了几个针对WSGI协议的存在已久的事实修订（相关代码示例也已经移植到Python3）。While for procedural reasons, this must be a distinct PEP, no changes were made that invalidate previously-compliant servers or applications under Python 2.x. If your 2.x application or server is compliant to PEP 333, it is also compliant with this PEP. 由于流程上的原因，本次修改是独立的，不会影响到Python2.x下服务端或应用端的程序。如果你的程序遵守PEP333，则它必然符合此次升级后的要求。Under Python 3, however, your app or server must also follow the rules outlined in the sections below titled, A Note On String Types, and Unicode Issues. 但是如果你的程序运行在Python3环境下，则必须注意下文中「字符串类型」和「Unicode编码」两节中的要求。For detailed, line-by-line diffs between this document and PEP 333, you may view its SVN revision history, from revision 84854 forward. 文本上的具体差别可以查看SVN历史版本，版本号84854之前的是老版。Abstract(摘要)This document specifies a proposed standard interface between web servers and Python web applications or frameworks, to promote web application portability across a variety of web servers. 本文档描述了Web服务器与Web应用或框架的标准交互接口，以提高PythonWeb应用在不同Web服务器之间具有可移植性。Original Rationale and Goals(from PEP 333)(原理和目标 (来自 PEP 333))Python currently boasts a wide variety of web application frameworks, such as Zope, Quixote, Webware, SkunkWeb, PSO, and Twisted Web -- to name just a few. This wide variety of choices can be a problem for new Python users, because generally speaking, their choice of web framework will limit their choice of usable web servers, and vice versa. Python目前有很多Web框架，比如Zope，Quixote，Webware，SkunkWeb，PSO和Twisted等等。新手面对如此多的选择十分纠结，因为一般来说，框架的选择会限制他们对Web服务器的选择，反之亦然。By contrast, although Java has just as many web application frameworks available, Java's servlet API makes it possible for applications written with any Java web application framework to run in any web server that supports the servlet API. 相比之下，Java也有非常多的Web框架，但是它的「servlet」API使得用户无论选择哪种框架，都可以保证程序正常运行在支持该API的任何Web服务器上。The availability and widespread use of such an API in web servers for Python -- whether those servers are written in Python (e.g. Medusa), embed Python (e.g. mod_python), or invoke Python via a gateway protocol (e.g. CGI, FastCGI, etc.) -- would separate choice of framework from choice of web server, freeing users to choose a pairing that suits them, while freeing framework and server developers to focus on their preferred area of specialization. 无论Web服务器是由Python写成，还是内嵌Python，抑或使用CGI和FastCGI之类的网关协议调用Python，在Python世界推广类似的API将使Web框架的选择与Web服务器无关，使框架和服务端的开发者能够专注于他们各自的领域。This PEP, therefore, proposes a simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks: the Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI). 因此本文档提出了一种简单且通用的接口以完成Web服务器与应用和框架的交互：PythonWeb服务器网关接口（WSGI）。But the mere existence of a WSGI spec does nothing to address the existing state of servers and frameworks for Python web applications. Server and framework authors and maintainers must actually implement WSGI for there to be any effect. 不过仅仅一个WSGI的存在并不足以缓解当前PythonWeb开发中的困境，只有在服务端和框架中真的实现了WSGI才行。However, since no existing servers or frameworks support WSGI, there is little immediate reward for an author who implements WSGI support. Thus, WSGI must be easy to implement, so that an author's initial investment in the interface can be reasonably low. 由于现有的服务端和框架并不支持WSGI，必须给哪些愿意支持WSGI的开发者们一点好处，故WSGI必须易于实现，以保证实现它的代价比较小。Thus, simplicity of implementation on both the server and framework sides of the interface is absolutely critical to the utility of the WSGI interface, and is therefore the principal criterion for any design decisions. 因此，在服务端和框架中都容易实现对于WSGI的实用性至关重要，也是所有设计决策的主要考量。Note, however, that simplicity of implementation for a framework author is not the same thing as ease of use for a web application author. WSGI presents an absolutely no frills interface to the framework author, because bells and whistles like response objects and cookie handling would just get in the way of existing frameworks' handling of these issues. Again, the goal of WSGI is to facilitate easy interconnection of existing servers and applications or frameworks, not to create a new web framework. 在Web框架中易于实现并不代表对Web应用开发者也易用。WSGI向Web框架开发者提供了绝对简洁的接口，因为类似响应对象（responseobjects）和cookie管理这样锦上添花的功能只会妨碍现有框架本身对应的功能。重申一遍，WSGI的目标是使现有Web服务器与Web应用或框架的交互变得更容易，而不是发明一个新的Web框架。Note also that this goal precludes WSGI from requiring anything that is not already available in deployed versions of Python. Therefore, new standard library modules are not proposed or required by this specification, and nothing in WSGI requires a Python version greater than 2.2.2. (It would be a good idea, however, for future versions of Python to include support for this interface in web servers provided by the standard library.) 这个目标要求WSGI不能依赖于任何在当前已部署的Python环境中不支持的功能。所以本次升级并没有产生新的标准库，且只要求用户的Python环境版本不低于2.2.2（不过在未来的Web服务器标准库中集成新标准应该是一个不错的选择）。In addition to ease of implementation for existing and future frameworks and servers, it should also be easy to create request preprocessors, response postprocessors, and other WSGI-based middleware components that look like an application to their containing server, while acting as a server for their contained applications. 除了在现有和未来出现的框架和服务端易于集成之外，WSGI还应该能很容易地创建请求预处理器、响应处理程序和其他基于WSGI的中间件组件（对于Web服务器它们是应用，但对于它们包含的应用来说则是服务器）。If middleware can be both simple and robust, and WSGI is widely available in servers and frameworks, it allows for the possibility of an entirely new kind of Python web application framework: one consisting of loosely-coupled WSGI middleware components. Indeed, existing framework authors may even choose to refactor their frameworks' existing services to be provided in this way, becoming more like libraries used with WSGI, and less like monolithic frameworks. This would then allow application developers to choose best-of-breed components for specific functionality, rather than having to commit to all the pros and cons of a single framework. 如果中间件能够既简洁又健壮，WSGI又在服务端和框架中广泛应用，这将使一种全新的PythonWeb框架得以出现：一种由各种松耦合的WSGI中间件组成的框架。现有的框架开发者们甚至会重构他们的现有服务，使他们的框架更像一些和WSGI配合的库而不是一个独立的框架。这样Web应用开发者就可以针对特定的需求选择最好的组件，而不是只能接受某一个框架的所有优点和缺点。Of course, as of this writing, that day is doubtless quite far off. In the meantime, it is a sufficient short-term goal for WSGI to enable the use of any framework with any server. 当然，前途是光明的，道路是曲折的，WSGI的短期目标是先让任意框架可以与任意Web服务器交互。Finally, it should be mentioned that the current version of WSGI does not prescribe any particular mechanism for deploying an application for use with a web server or server gateway. At the present time, this is necessarily implementation-defined by the server or gateway. After a sufficient number of servers and frameworks have implemented WSGI to provide field experience with varying deployment requirements, it may make sense to create another PEP, describing a deployment standard for WSGI servers and application frameworks. 最后需要注意的是，当前版本的WSGI并没有规定一个应用具体以何种方式部署在Web服务器或网关服务器上，目前这由二者的具体实现决定。如果足够多实现了WSGI的服务器或网关在实践中产生了这个需求，也许可以另写一份PEP来描述WSGI服务器和应用框架的部署标准。Specification Overview(规范概述)The WSGI interface has two sides: the server or gateway side, and the application or framework side. The server side invokes a callable object that is provided by the application side. The specifics of how that object is provided are up to the server or gateway. It is assumed that some servers or gateways will require an application's deployer to write a short script to create an instance of the server or gateway, and supply it with the application object. Other servers and gateways may use configuration files or other mechanisms to specify where an application object should be imported from, or otherwise obtained. WSGI接口有两种形式：服务端和应用端。服务端请求一个由应用端提供的可调用的对象，至于该对象应当如何被提供取决于服务端。有些服务端需要应用程序的部署人员编写一个简短的脚本来启动一个Web服务器或网关服务器的实例，以为此实例提供所需对象；而另一些服务端则需要配置文件或其他机制来指定从哪里导入或者得到所需对象。In addition to pure servers/gateways and applications/frameworks, it is also possible to create middleware components that implement both sides of this specification. Such components act as an application to their containing server, and as a server to a contained application, and can be used to provide extended APIs, content transformation, navigation, and other useful functions. 除了Web服务器/网关服务器和Web应用/开发框架，还可以创建包含两种接口的中间件组件：对于Web服务器它们是应用，而对于应用来说他们是服务器。中间件可以用来提供扩展API，内容转换，导航和其他有用的功能。Throughout this specification, we will use the term a callable to mean a function, method, class, or an instance with a __call__ method. It is up to the server, gateway, or application implementing the callable to choose the appropriate implementation technique for their needs. Conversely, a server, gateway, or application that is invoking a callable must not have any dependency on what kind of callable was provided to it. Callables are only to be called, not introspected upon. 在本文档中，我们使用术语「可调用者」代表「一个函数，方法，类，或者拥有__call__方法的一个实例」。实现「可调用者」的Web服务器，网关服务器或应用程序可以根据需要选择合适的实现方式；相反，请求「可调用者」的Web服务器，网关服务器或应用程序不可以依赖具体的实现方式。「可调用者」只能被调用，不能自省。A Note on String Types(一条关于字符串类型的笔记)In general, HTTP deals with bytes, which means that this specification is mostly about handling bytes. 一般来说，HTTP协议处理字节流，也就是说本文档主要面向字节流的处理。However, the content of those bytes often has some kind of textual interpretation, and in Python, strings are the most convenient way to handle text. 不过字节流经常是文本意义上可读的，而在Python中，字符串类型是处理文本的趁手工具。But in many Python versions and implementations, strings are Unicode, rather than bytes. This requires a careful balance between a usable API and correct translations between bytes and text in the context of HTTP... especially to support porting code between Python implementations with different str types. 但是在很多Python的版本和实现中，字符串是Unicode编码的，而不是字节流。这要求我们在HTTP字节流与文本的相互转换和好用的API之间保持很好的平衡，尤其要注意支持基于不同版本的Python程序之间的可移植性，这些版本中字符串类型不尽相同。WSGI therefore defines two kinds of string: 因此WSGI定义了两种字符串类型：Native strings (which are always implemented using the type named str) that are used for request/response headers and metadata 原生字符串（一般使用str类型实现）。这种字符串用在请求和响应的包头和元数据中。Bytestrings (which are implemented using the bytes type in Python 3, and str elsewhere), that are used for the bodies of requests and responses (e.g. POST/PUT input data and HTML page outputs). 字节流字符串（在Python3中使用bytes类型实现，其他版本中使用str类型实现）。这种字符串用在请求和响应的包内容中（比如POST方法或PUT方法的输入数据以及HTML页面的输出）。Do not be confused however: even if Python's str type is actually Unicode under the hood, the content of native strings must still be translatable to bytes via the Latin-1 encoding! (See the section on Unicode Issues later in this document for more details.) 大家一定要注意不要搞混了：即使Python的str类型实质上是Unicode编码的，但是原生字符串的内容仍然将通过Latin-1编码转换为字节流（参见下文「Unicode编码」一节可获得更多信息）。In short: where you see the word string in this document, it refers to a native string, i.e., an object of type str, whether it is internally implemented as bytes or unicode. Where you see references to bytestring, this should be read as an object of type bytes under Python 3, or type str under Python 2. 简而言之，本文档中的「字符串」这个词都是指「原生字符串」，亦即一个str类型的对象，无论其实质上是字节流还是Unicode编码。任何地方出现的「字节流字符串」，都是指Python3下bytes类型的一个实例，或者Python2下str类型的一个实例。And so, even though HTTP is in some sense really just bytes, there are many API conveniences to be had by using whatever Python's default str type is. 因此，虽然HTTP某种意义上来说就是字节流，使用Python默认的字符串类型来解析会带来不少API使用上的好处。The Application/Framework Side(应用/框架端)The application object is simply a callable object that accepts two arguments. The term object should not be misconstrued as requiring an actual object instance: a function, method, class, or instance with a __call__ method are all acceptable for use as an application object. Application objects must be able to be invoked more than once, as virtually all servers/gateways (other than CGI) will make such repeated requests. 应用端接口应用对象是一个简单的接受两个参数的可调用对象。这里的对象并不是真的需要一个对象实例，一个函数、方法、类、或者带有__call__方法的对象实例都可以当作应用对象。应用对象必须可以多次被调用，因为实际上所有的服务端（而非CGI）都会产生这样的重复请求。(Note: although we refer to it as an application object, this should not be construed to mean that application developers will use WSGI as a web programming API! It is assumed that application developers will continue to use existing, high-level framework services to develop their applications. WSGI is a tool for framework and server developers, and is not intended to directly support application developers.) （注意：虽然我们称之为「应用」对象，但这并不是说程序员可以把WSGI当做Web编程API来调用！我们假定应用开发者仍然使用更高层面上的框架服务来开发应用，WSGI是提供给框架和Web服务器开发者使用的工具，并不打算直接对应用开发者提供支持。）Here are two example application objects; one is a function, and the other is a class: 这里有两个应用对象的示例，一个是函数，另一个是类:123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233HELLO_WORLD = b"Hello world!\n"def simple_app(environ, start_response): """Simplest possible application object""" status = '200 OK' response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')] start_response(status, response_headers) return [HELLO_WORLD]class AppClass: """Produce the same output, but using a class (Note: 'AppClass' is the "application" here, so calling it returns an instance of 'AppClass', which is then the iterable return value of the "application callable" as required by the spec. If we wanted to use *instances* of 'AppClass' as application objects instead, we would have to implement a '__call__' method, which would be invoked to execute the application, and we would need to create an instance for use by the server or gateway. """ def __init__(self, environ, start_response): self.environ = environ self.start = start_response def __iter__(self): status = '200 OK' response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')] self.start(status, response_headers) yield HELLO_WORLDThe Server/Gateway Side(服务器/网关端)The server or gateway invokes the application callable once for each request it receives from an HTTP client, that is directed at the application. To illustrate, here is a simple CGI gateway, implemented as a function taking an application object. Note that this simple example has limited error handling, because by default an uncaught exception will be dumped to sys.stderr and logged by the web server. 服务端接口服务端为HTTP客户端发来的每一个请求调用一次可调用者，这是由应用决定的（？）。为了方便说明，这里以一个获取应用对象的函数实现了一个简单的CGI网关。请注意，这个例子的错误处理功能很有限，因为默认情况下没有被捕获的异常都会被输出到sys.stderr并被Web服务器记录下来。:123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475import os, sysenc, esc = sys.getfilesystemencoding(), 'surrogateescape'def unicode_to_wsgi(u): # Convert an environment variable to a WSGI "bytes-as-unicode" string return u.encode(enc, esc).decode('iso-8859-1')def wsgi_to_bytes(s): return s.encode('iso-8859-1')def run_with_cgi(application): environ = &#123;k: unicode_to_wsgi(v) for k,v in os.environ.items()&#125; environ['wsgi.input'] = sys.stdin.buffer environ['wsgi.errors'] = sys.stderr environ['wsgi.version'] = (1, 0) environ['wsgi.multithread'] = False environ['wsgi.multiprocess'] = True environ['wsgi.run_once'] = True if environ.get('HTTPS', 'off') in ('on', '1'): environ['wsgi.url_scheme'] = 'https' else: environ['wsgi.url_scheme'] = 'http' headers_set = [] headers_sent = [] def write(data): out = sys.stdout.buffer if not headers_set: raise AssertionError("write() before start_response()") elif not headers_sent: # Before the first output, send the stored headers status, response_headers = headers_sent[:] = headers_set out.write(wsgi_to_bytes('Status: %s\r\n' % status)) for header in response_headers: out.write(wsgi_to_bytes('%s: %s\r\n' % header)) out.write(wsgi_to_bytes('\r\n')) out.write(data) out.flush() def start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info=None): if exc_info: try: if headers_sent: # Re-raise original exception if headers sent raise exc_info[1].with_traceback(exc_info[2]) finally: exc_info = None # avoid dangling circular ref elif headers_set: raise AssertionError("Headers already set!") headers_set[:] = [status, response_headers] # Note: error checking on the headers should happen here, # *after* the headers are set.

Such middleware components can perform such functions as: 分饰两角的组件同一个对象既可以作为服务端存在，也可以作为应用端存在。这样的中间件可以完成以下功能:Routing a request to different application objects based on the target URL, after rewriting the environ accordingly. 重写上文代码中的environ之后，可以根据目标URL将请求转发到不同的应用程序对象Allowing multiple applications or frameworks to run side-by-side in the same process 允许多个应用程序或框架在一个进程中同时运行Load balancing and remote processing, by forwarding requests and responses over a network 通过转发请求和响应，实现负载均衡和远程处理Perform content postprocessing, such as applying XSL stylesheets 对内容进行后期处理，比如引入XSL样式表The presence of middleware in general is transparent to both the server/gateway and the application/framework sides of the interface, and should require no special support. A user who desires to incorporate middleware into an application simply provides the middleware component to the server, as if it were an application, and configures the middleware component to invoke the application, as if the middleware component were a server. Of course, the application that the middleware wraps may in fact be another middleware component wrapping another application, and so on, creating what is referred to as a middleware stack. 中间件的存在对于服务端和应用端来说都应该是透明的，并且不需要特殊的支持。希望在应用程序中加入中间件的用户只需简单的把中间件当作应用提供给Web服务器，并配置中间件使其以服务器的身份与应用程序交互即可。当然，中间件包装后提供给服务器的应用也可以是另一个中间件，如此连锁下去便构成了所谓的「中间件栈」。For the most part, middleware must conform to the restrictions and requirements of both the server and application sides of WSGI. In some cases, however, requirements for middleware are more stringent than for a pure server or application, and these points will be noted in the specification. 一般情况下，中间件要符合WSGI对应用端和服务端提出的一些限制和要求，有些时候这样的限制甚至比纯粹的服务端或应用端还要严格，这些地方我们会特别指出。Here is a (tongue-in-cheek) example of a middleware component that converts text/plain responses to pig Latin, using Joe Strout's piglatin.py. (Note: a real middleware component would probably use a more robust way of checking the content type, and should also check for a content encoding. Also, this simple example ignores the possibility that a word might be split across a block boundary.) 下面是一个非正式的中间件组件的示例，使用JoeStrout的piglatin.py将text/plain的响应转换成儿童黑话（注意：真正的中间件应该使用更加安全的方式——应该检查内容的类型和编码，而且这个简单的例子还忽略了一个单词可能会被拆分到两个包中的可能性)。1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768from piglatin import piglatinclass LatinIter: """Transform iterated output to piglatin, if it's okay to do so Note that the "okayness" can change until the application yields its first non-empty bytestring, so 'transform_ok' has to be a mutable truth value.

For the sake of illustration, we have named them environ and start_response, but they are not required to have these names. A server or gateway must invoke the application object using positional (not keyword) arguments. (E.g. by calling result = application(environ, start_response) as shown above.) 应用对象必须接受两个形式参数，为了方便说明我们不妨分别命名为environ和start_response，但这并不是强制的。服务端必须使用形式参数（而非关键字）调用应用对象（就像这样：result=application(environ,start_response)）。The environ parameter is a dictionary object, containing CGI-style environment variables. This object must be a builtin Python dictionary (not a subclass, UserDict or other dictionary emulation), and the application is allowed to modify the dictionary in any way it desires. The dictionary must also include certain WSGI-required variables (described in a later section), and may also include server-specific extension variables, named according to a convention that will be described below. environ参数是个字典对象，包含CGI风格的环境变量。这个对象必须是一个Python内建的字典对象（不能是子类、UserDict或其他对字典对象的模仿），应用程序可以以任意方式修改这个字典。environ还应该包含一些特定的WSGI所需的变量（在后面的小节里会详述），也可以包含一些服务器特定的扩展变量，通过下文的约定命名。The start_response parameter is a callable accepting two required positional arguments, and one optional argument. For the sake of illustration, we have named these arguments status, response_headers, and exc_info, but they are not required to have these names, and the application must invoke the start_response callable using positional arguments (e.g. start_response(status, response_headers)). start_response参数是一个接受两个固定参数和一个可选参数的可调用者。为了方便说明，我们分别命名为status、response_headers和exc_info，同样的，这样命名也不是强制的。应用程序必须用形式参数来调用start_response（就像这样：start_response(status,response_headers)）。The status parameter is a status string of the form 999 Message here, and response_headers is a list of (header_name, header_value) tuples describing the HTTP response header. The optional exc_info parameter is described below in the sections on The start_response() Callable and Error Handling. It is used only when the application has trapped an error and is attempting to display an error message to the browser. status参数是一个形式上像「999Messagehere」这样的状态字符串。而response_headers参数是一个(header_name,header_value)元组的列表，用来描述HTTP响应头。可选的exc_info参数会在下面的「start_response()函数」和「错误处理」两节中详述，它只有在应用程序产生了错误并希望在浏览器上显示相关信息的时候才有用。The start_response callable must return a write(body_data) callable that takes one positional parameter: a bytestring to be written as part of the HTTP response body. (Note: the write() callable is provided only to support certain existing frameworks' imperative output APIs; it should not be used by new applications or frameworks if it can be avoided. See the Buffering and Streaming section for more details.) start_response可调用者必须返回一个write(body_data)可调用者，它接受一个形式参数：一个将要被作为HTTP响应体的一部分输出的字节流字符串（注意：提供可调用者write()只是为了支持现有框架的必要的输出API，新的应用程序或框架尽量避免使用，详细情况参见缓冲区和流处理一节）。When called by the server, the application object must return an iterable yielding zero or more bytestrings. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as by returning a list of bytestrings, or by the application being a generator function that yields bytestrings, or by the application being a class whose instances are iterable. Regardless of how it is accomplished, the application object must always return an iterable yielding zero or more bytestrings. 当被服务器调用的时候，应用对象必须返回一个生成0或多个字节流字符串的迭代器，这可以通过多种方法实现，比如返回一个字节流字符串的列表，或者应用程序本身是一个字节流字符串的生成器，或者应用程序是一个类而其实例是可迭代的.不管怎么实现，应用对象必须总是返回一个生成0或多个字节流字符串的迭代器。The server or gateway must transmit the yielded bytestrings to the client in an unbuffered fashion, completing the transmission of each bytestring before requesting another one. (In other words, applications should perform their own buffering. See the Buffering and Streaming section below for more on how application output must be handled.) 服务器端必须将生成的字节流字符串以一种无缓冲的方式传送到客户端，每次传完一个再去获取下一个（换句话说，应用程序应该自己实现缓冲，更多关于应用程序如何处理输出的细节参见「缓冲区和流处理」小节）。The server or gateway should treat the yielded bytestrings as binary byte sequences: in particular, it should ensure that line endings are not altered. The application is responsible for ensuring that the bytestring(s) to be written are in a format suitable for the client. (The server or gateway may apply HTTP transfer encodings, or perform other transformations for the purpose of implementing HTTP features such as byte-range transmission. See Other HTTP Features, below, for more details.) 服务端应该把产生的字节流字符串当作字节流对待：尤其必须保证没修改行尾。应用程序负责确保字符串以与客户端匹配的编码输出（服务端可能会附加HTTP传送编码，或者为了实现一些HTTP特性而进行一些转换，比如字节范围转换（？），更多细节参见「其他HTTP特性」小节）If a call to len(iterable) succeeds, the server must be able to rely on the result being accurate. That is, if the iterable returned by the application provides a working __len__() method, it must return an accurate result. (See the Handling the Content-Length Header section for information on how this would normally be used.) 如果调用len(iterable)成功，服务器将认为结果是正确的。也就是说，应用程序返回的可迭代的字符串提供了一个靠谱的__len__()方法，那么肯定返回了正确的结果（关于这个方法正常情况下如何被使用参见「处理Content-Length头」）。If the iterable returned by the application has a close() method, the server or gateway must call that method upon completion of the current request, whether the request was completed normally, or terminated early due to an application error during iteration or an early disconnect of the browser. (The close() method requirement is to support resource release by the application. This protocol is intended to complement PEP 342's generator support, and other common iterables with close() methods.) 如果应用程序返回的迭代器有close()方法，则不管该请求是正常结束还是由于迭代错误或浏览器失去连接而终止，服务端都必须在结束该请求之前调用这个方法（这是用来支持应用程序对资源的释放，以完善PEP342的生成器支持和其他含有close()方法的一般迭代器）。Applications returning a generator or other custom iterator should not assume the entire iterator will be consumed, as it may be closed early by the server. 应用程序返回的生成器或其他定制的迭代器并不一定会被使用，可能直接就被服务端关闭了。(Note: the application must invoke the start_response() callable before the iterable yields its first body bytestring, so that the server can send the headers before any body content. However, this invocation may be performed by the iterable's first iteration, so servers must not assume that start_response() has been called before they begin iterating over the iterable.) （注意：应用程序必须在迭代器生成第一个字节流字符串之前调用start_response()可调用者，这样服务器才能在发送任何主体内容之前发送响应头。不过这一步也可以在迭代器第一次迭代的时候进行，所以服务器不能假定开始迭代之前start_response()已经被调用过了。）Finally, servers and gateways must not directly use any other attributes of the iterable returned by the application, unless it is an instance of a type specific to that server or gateway, such as a file wrapper returned by wsgi.file_wrapper (see Optional Platform-Specific File Handling). In the general case, only attributes specified here, or accessed via e.g. the PEP 234 iteration APIs are acceptable. 除以上提及的之外，服务端不能直接使用任何应用程序返回的迭代器属性，除非该属性是针对服务端特定类型的一个实例，比如wsgi.file_wrapper返回的「文件包装器」（参见「（可选）特定平台上的文件处理」）。通常情况下，只有这里指定的属性，或者通过如PEP234迭代API之类的途径获取的其他属性才是可以访问的。environ Variables(环境变量)The environ dictionary is required to contain these CGI environment variables, as defined by the Common Gateway Interface specification. The following variables must be present, unless their value would be an empty string, in which case they may be omitted, except as otherwise noted below. environ字典中要求包含下面这些在CGI规范中定义了的CGI环境变量。除非其值是空字符串（这种情况下如果下面没有特别指出的话它们可能会被忽略），下面这些变量必须存在：REQUEST_METHODThe HTTP request method, such as GET or POST. This cannot ever be an empty string, and so is always required. HTTP请求的类型，比如「GET」或者「POST」。这个不可能是空字符串，所以是必须给出的。SCRIPT_NAMEThe initial portion of the request URL's path that corresponds to the application object, so that the application knows its virtual location. This may be an empty string, if the application corresponds to the root of the server. URL请求中路径的开始部分，对应应用程序对象（？），这样应用程序就知道它的虚拟位置。如果该应用程序对应服务器的根目录的话，它可能是空字符串。PATH_INFOThe remainder of the request URL's path, designating the virtual location of the request's target within the application. This may be an empty string, if the request URL targets the application root and does not have a trailing slash. URL请求中路径的剩余部分，指定请求的目标在应用程序内部的虚拟位置（？）。如果请求的目标是应用程序根目录并且没有末尾的斜杠的话，可能为空字符串。QUERY_STRINGThe portion of the request URL that follows the ?, if any. May be empty or absent. URL请求中跟在「?」后面的那部分，可能为空或不存在。CONTENT_TYPEThe contents of any Content-Type fields in the HTTP request. May be empty or absent. HTTP请求中任何Content-Type域的内容，可能为空或不存在。CONTENT_LENGTHThe contents of any Content-Length fields in the HTTP request. May be empty or absent. HTTP请求中任何Content-Length域的内容，可能为空或不存在。SERVER_NAME, SERVER_PORTWhen combined with SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO, these two strings can be used to complete the URL. Note, however, that HTTP_HOST, if present, should be used in preference to SERVER_NAME for reconstructing the request URL. See the URL Reconstruction section below for more detail. SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT can never be empty strings, and so are always required. 这些变量可以和SCRIPT_NAME、PATH_INFO一起组成完整的URL。然而要注意的是，重建请求URL的时候应该优先使用HTTP_HOST而非SERVER_NAME。详细内容参见「URL重建」。SERVER_NAME和SERVER_PORT永远不能为空字符串，也总是必须存在的。SERVER_PROTOCOLThe version of the protocol the client used to send the request. Typically this will be something like HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 and may be used by the application to determine how to treat any HTTP request headers. (This variable should probably be called REQUEST_PROTOCOL, since it denotes the protocol used in the request, and is not necessarily the protocol that will be used in the server's response. However, for compatibility with CGI we have to keep the existing name.) 客户端发送请求所使用协议的版本。通常是类似「HTTP/1.0」或「HTTP/1.1」的东西，可以被用来判断如何处理请求包头。（既然这个变量表示的是请求中使用的协议，而且和服务器响应时使用的协议无关，也许它应该被叫做REQUEST_PROTOCOL。不过为了保持和CGI的兼容性，我们还是使用这个名字。）HTTP_ VariablesVariables corresponding to the client-supplied HTTP request headers (i.e., variables whose names begin with HTTP_). The presence or absence of these variables should correspond with the presence or absence of the appropriate HTTP header in the request. 对应客户端提供的HTTP请求包头（即名字以「HTTP_」开头的各种变量）。这些变量的存在与否应该与请求中对应的HTTP包头是否存在相一致。A server or gateway should attempt to provide as many other CGI variables as are applicable. In addition, if SSL is in use, the server or gateway should also provide as many of the Apache SSL environment variables as are applicable, such as HTTPS=on and SSL_PROTOCOL. Note, however, that an application that uses any CGI variables other than the ones listed above are necessarily non-portable to web servers that do not support the relevant extensions. (For example, web servers that do not publish files will not be able to provide a meaningful DOCUMENT_ROOT or PATH_TRANSLATED.) 服务端应该尽可能提供所有可用的CGI变量。另外，如果使用了SSL，服务端也应该尽可能提供所有可用的ApacheSSL环境变量，比如HTTPS=on和SSL_PROTOCOL。不过要注意，使用了任何上面没有列出的CGI变量的应用程序对不支持相关扩展的服务器来说就不具有可移植性了。（比如，不发布文件的Web服务器就不能提供有意义的DOCUMENT_ROOT变量或PATH_TRANSLATED变量。）A WSGI-compliant server or gateway should document what variables it provides, along with their definitions as appropriate. Applications should check for the presence of any variables they require, and have a fallback plan in the event such a variable is absent. 支持WSGI的服务端应该在自述文档中说明它们可以提供些什么变量；应用端则应该简称所有需要的变量的存在性，并且在某变量不存在的时候有备用方案。Note: missing variables (such as REMOTE_USER when no authentication has occurred) should be left out of the environ dictionary. Also note that CGI-defined variables must be native strings, if they are present at all. It is a violation of this specification for any CGI variable's value to be of any type other than str. 注意:不存在的变量（比如在不需要验证的情况下的REMOTE_USER变量）应该被移出environ字典。另外要注意CGI定义的变量如果存在的话必须是原生字符串。任何str类型以外的CGI变量都是不符合本规范。In addition to the CGI-defined variables, the environ dictionary may also contain arbitrary operating-system environment variables, and must contain the following WSGI-defined variables: 除了CGI定义的变量，environ字典也可以包含任意操作系统的环境变量，并且必须包含下面这些WSGI定义的变量:VariableValuewsgi.versionThe tuple (1, 0), representing WSGI version 1.0. (1,0)元组，代表WSGI1.0版wsgi.url_schemeA string representing the scheme portion of the URL at which the application is being invoked. Normally, this will have the value http or https, as appropriate. 字符串，表示应用请求的URL所属的协议，通常为「http」或「https」。wsgi.inputAn input stream (file-like object) from which the HTTP request body bytes can be read. (The server or gateway may perform reads on-demand as requested by the application, or it may pre- read the client's request body and buffer it in-memory or on disk, or use any other technique for providing such an input stream, according to its preference.) 类文件对象的输入流，用于读取HTTP请求包体的内容。（服务端在应用端请求时开始读取，或者预读客户端请求包体内容缓存在内存或磁盘中，或者视情况而定采用任何其他技术提供此输入流。）wsgi.errorsAn output stream (file-like object) to which error output can be written, for the purpose of recording program or other errors in a standardized and possibly centralized location. This should be a text mode stream; i.e., applications should use as a line ending, and assume that it will be converted to the correct line ending by the server/gateway. 类文件对象的输出流，用于写入错误信息，以集中规范地记录程序产生的或其他相关错误信息。这是一个文本流，即应用应该使用「n」来表示行尾，并假定其会被服务端正确地转换。(On platforms where the str type is unicode, the error stream should accept and log arbitrary unicode without raising an error; it is allowed, however, to substitute characters that cannot be rendered in the stream's encoding.) （在str类型是Unicode编码的平台上，错误流应该正常接收并记录任意Unicode编码而不报错，并且允许自行替代在该平台编码中无法渲染的字符。）For many servers, wsgi.errors will be the server's main error log. Alternatively, this may be sys.stderr, or a log file of some sort. he server's documentation should include an explanation of how to configure this or where to find the recorded output. A server or gateway may supply different error streams to different applications, if this is desired. 很多Web服务器中wsgi.errors是主要的错误日志，也有一些使用sys.stderr或其他形式的文件来记录。Web服务器的自述文档中应该包含如何配置错误日志以及如何找到记录的位置。服务端可以在被要求的情况下，向不同的应用提供不同的错误日志。wsgi.multithreadThis value should evaluate true if the application object may be simultaneously invoked by another thread in the same process, and should evaluate false otherwise. 如果应用对象可能会被同一进程的另一个线程同步调用，此变量值为真，否则为假。wsgi.multiprocessThis value should evaluate true if an equivalent application object may be simultaneously invoked by another process, and should evaluate false otherwise. 如果同一个应用对象可能会被另一个进程同步调用，此变量值为真，否则为假。wsgi.run_oneThis value should evaluate true if the server or gateway expects (but does not guarantee!) that the application will only be invoked this one time during the life of its containing process. Normally, this will only be true for a gateway based on CGI (or something similar). 如果服务端期望（但是不保证能得到满足）应用对象在生命周期中之辈调用一次，此变量值为真，否则为假。一般只有在基于类似CGI的网关服务器中此变量才会为真。Finally, the environ dictionary may also contain server-defined variables. These variables should be named using only lower-case letters, numbers, dots, and underscores, and should be prefixed with a name that is unique to the defining server or gateway. For example, mod_python might define variables with names like mod_python.some_variable. 最后，environ字典也可以包含服务端定义的变量。这些变量的名称应当由小写字母、数字、点和下划线组成，并且应当带有一个所在服务端独有的前缀。比如mod_python可以定义mod_python.some_variable这样的变量。Input and Error Streams(输入和错误流)The input and error streams provided by the server must support the following methods: 输入流和错误流服务器提供的输入和错误流必须提供以下方法:MethodStreamNotesread(size)input1readline()input1,2readlines(hint)input1,3iter()inputflush()errors4write(str)errorswritelines(seq)errorsThe semantics of each method are as documented in the Python Library Reference, except for these notes as listed in the table above: 每个方法的语义如果上面没有特别指出均和Python标准库介绍中记载的一样:The server is not required to read past the client's specified Content-Length, and should simulate an end-of-file condition if the application attempts to read past that point. The application should not attempt to read more data than is specified by the CONTENT_LENGTH variable. 不要求Web服务器读取超过客户端指定的Content-Length的内容，并且应该在应用尝试读取越界内容时虚拟出一个文件结束符。应用不应该尝试读取超过Content-Length指定长度的内容。A server should allow read() to be called without an argument, and return the remainder of the client's input stream. Web服务器应该允许不使用参数调用read()，并返回客户端输入流剩余的部分；A server should return empty bytestrings from any attempt to read from an empty or exhausted input stream. 同时服务器应该对任何尝试读取空的或到文件尾的输入流的行为返回空字符串。Servers should support the optional size argument to readline(), but as in WSGI 1.0, they are allowed to omit support for it. Web服务器应该支持readline()函数的可选「size」参数，但是在WSGI1.0版本中可以忽略这一点。(In WSGI 1.0, the size argument was not supported, on the grounds that it might have been complex to implement, and was not often used in practice... but then the cgi module started using it, and so practical servers had to start supporting it anyway!) （在WSGI1.0中，「size」参数并不要求提供，因为可能很难实现也不常用。但是由于CGI模块开始支持它了，所以生产环境中的Web服务器还是得实现「size」参数。）Note that the hint argument to readlines() is optional for both caller and implementer. The application is free not to supply it, and the server or gateway is free to ignore it. readlines()函数的「hint」参数对于调用者和实现者来说都是可选的。应用端完全可以忽略它，服务端亦然。Since the errors stream may not be rewound, servers and gateways are free to forward write operations immediately, without buffering. In this case, the flush() method may be a no-op. Portable applications, however, cannot assume that output is unbuffered or that flush() is a no-op. They must call flush() if they need to ensure that output has in fact been written. (For example, to minimize intermingling of data from multiple processes writing to the same error log.) 由于错误流不能重设读写位置，服务端可以使用无缓冲模式来进行写操作。在这种情况下，flush()函数不做任何操作。但是具有良好可移植性的程序不能假设输出流是无缓冲或flush()函数是误操作的，而应当在需要输出真的被写到存储设备中的时候调用flush()函数。（比如防止多进程写数据造成的混乱这种情况。）The methods listed in the table above must be supported by all servers conforming to this specification. Applications conforming to this specification must not use any other methods or attributes of the input or errors objects. In particular, applications must not attempt to close these streams, even if they possess close() methods. 上表中列出的方法必须被所有遵守本规范的服务端支持。遵守本规范的应用端则不应该调用任何其他的输入流和输出流相关的方法和属性。尤其要注意的是，应用端即使在这些流提供close()方法的情况下，也不应该尝试关闭它们。The start_response() Callable(可调用start_response())The second parameter passed to the application object is a callable of the form start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info=None). (As with all WSGI callables, the arguments must be supplied positionally, not by keyword.) The start_response callable is used to begin the HTTP response, and it must return a write(body_data) callable (see the Buffering and Streaming section, below). start_response()可调用者传给应用程序对象的第二个参数是一个形为start_response(status,response_headers,exc_info=None)的可调用者。（像WSGI的所有其他可调用者一样，这个参数必须使用形式参数提供，而不能以关键字参数提供。）start_response可调用者用于开始HTTP响应，它必须返回一个write(body_data)可调用者（参见缓冲区和流处理）。The status argument is an HTTP status string like 200 OK or 404 Not Found. That is, it is a string consisting of a Status-Code and a Reason-Phrase, in that order and separated by a single space, with no surrounding whitespace or other characters. (See RFC 2616, Section 6.1.1 for more information.) The string must not contain control characters, and must not be terminated with a carriage return, linefeed, or combination thereof. status参数是一个形如「200OK」或「404NotFound」这样的HTTP状态字符串。换言之是一个由状态编号和具体信息组成的字符串，按顺序并用空格隔开，两头没有其他空格和其他字符。（更多信息参见RFC2616，6.1.1小节。）该字符串禁止包含控制字符，也不允许以回车、换行或二者的组合形式结尾。The response_headers argument is a list of (header_name, header_value) tuples. It must be a Python list; i.e. type(response_headers) is ListType, and the server may change its contents in any way it desires. Each header_name must be a valid HTTP header field-name (as defined by RFC 2616, Section 4.2), without a trailing colon or other punctuation. response_headers参数是一个(header_name,header_value)元组的列表。它必须是一个Python中的列表，即type(response_headers)的值为ListType，并且Web服务器可以以任何方式改变其内容。每一个header_name必须是一个不含冒号或其他标点符号的合法的HTTPheader字段名（RFC26164.2小节中有详细定义）。Each header_value must not include any control characters, including carriage returns or linefeeds, either embedded or at the end. (These requirements are to minimize the complexity of any parsing that must be performed by servers, gateways, and intermediate response processors that need to inspect or modify response headers.) 每一个header_value禁止包含任何控制字符（包括回车或换行）。（这些要求是为了将那些必须检查或修改响应头的服务端和中间件所必须执行的解析工作的复杂性降到最低。）In general, the server or gateway is responsible for ensuring that correct headers are sent to the client: if the application omits a header required by HTTP (or other relevant specifications that are in effect), the server or gateway must add it. For example, the HTTP Date: and Server: headers would normally be supplied by the server or gateway. 一般来说，服务端要保证发送到客户端的包头的正确性：如果应用忽略了HTTP规定的包头（或其他类似的内容）服务端必须自己加上。比如HTTP的「Date:」和「Server:」包头一般都是由服务端提供的。(A reminder for server/gateway authors: HTTP header names are case-insensitive, so be sure to take that into consideration when examining application-supplied headers!) （服务端开发者小贴士：HTTP包头名称是大小写敏感的，所以请确保你们检查应用提供的包头时考虑了这一点！）Applications and middleware are forbidden from using HTTP/1.1 hop-by-hop features or headers, any equivalent features in HTTP/1.0, or any headers that would affect the persistence of the client's connection to the web server. These features are the exclusive province of the actual web server, and a server or gateway should consider it a fatal error for an application to attempt sending them, and raise an error if they are supplied to start_response(). (For more specifics on hop-by-hop features and headers, please see the Other HTTP Features section below.) 应用和中间件禁止使用HTTP/1.1中的「逐跳」机制和包头，HTTP/1.0中类似的机制也禁用，任何应用客户端到Web服务器的连接持久性的包头也都不允许使用。使用这些特性是服务端的特权，服务端发现客户端违反此规定时应视为致命错误，需在请求提交到start_response()时报错。（关于「逐跳」特性和包头，请参见「其他HTTP特性」小节。）Servers should check for errors in the headers at the time start_response is called, so that an error can be raised while the application is still running. 在start_response被调用时Web服务器需要检查是否有错误，所以可以在应用正在运行的时候报错。However, the start_response callable must not actually transmit the response headers. Instead, it must store them for the server or gateway to transmit only after the first iteration of the application return value that yields a non-empty bytestring, or upon the application's first invocation of the write() callable. In other words, response headers must not be sent until there is actual body data available, or until the application's returned iterable is exhausted. (The only possible exception to this rule is if the response headers explicitly include a Content-Length of zero.) 但是，start_response可调用者禁止传送响应包头。只能在服务端缓存起来，当且仅当应用的第一次迭代完成并返回一个非空字节流字符串或应用第一次调用write()可调用者的时候才能由服务端传送。换言之，响应包头只有在包体数据已经准备好，或者应用返回的迭代器已经迭代完成的时候才能被传送出去。（唯一的例外是响应包头显式包含了一个值为零的Content-Length字段。）This delaying of response header transmission is to ensure that buffered and asynchronous applications can replace their originally intended output with error output, up until the last possible moment. For example, the application may need to change the response status from 200 OK to 500 Internal Error, if an error occurs while the body is being generated within an application buffer. 响应包头的延迟传送是为了保证带缓冲区和异步的应用能够将它们原生的输出替换为错误流，一直到所能允许的最后一刻。举例来说，当应用使用缓冲区生成包体的时候如果出错，应用可能需要将响应状态从「200OK」改为「500InternalErrorThe exc_info argument, if supplied, must be a Python sys.exc_info() tuple. This argument should be supplied by the application only if start_response is being called by an error handler. If exc_info is supplied, and no HTTP headers have been output yet, start_response should replace the currently-stored HTTP response headers with the newly-supplied ones, thus allowing the application to change its mind about the output when an error has occurred. 如果提供了exc_info参数，则其必须为Python中的sys.exc_info()元组。只有当start_response被错误处理程序调用时，这个参数才应当被提供。如果提供了exc_info参数且没有尚未有任何HTTP包头输出，start_response应该将当前缓存的HTTP响应包头替换成新生成的，从而允许应用在错误发生的时候修改输出。However, if exc_info is provided, and the HTTP headers have already been sent, start_response must raise an error, and should re-raise using the exc_info tuple. That is: 但是，如果HTTP包头在其时已有输出，start_response必须报错，且应当使用exc_info元组再报一次：:1raise exc_info[1].with_traceback(exc_info[2])This will re-raise the exception trapped by the application, and in principle should abort the application. (It is not safe for the application to attempt error output to the browser once the HTTP headers have already been sent.) The application must not trap any exceptions raised by start_response, if it called start_response with exc_info. Instead, it should allow such exceptions to propagate back to the server or gateway. See Error Handling below, for more details. 以上代码会把应用捕获的异常再抛出一次，原则上会终止应用。（当HTTP包头已经被送出后应用尝试将错误信息输出至浏览器的行为是不安全的。）如果应用使用exc_info参数调用start_response，则禁止捕获任何由start_response抛出的异常，而应该让该异常被返回到服务端。详见「错误处理」小节。The application may call start_response more than once, if and only if the exc_info argument is provided. More precisely, it is a fatal error to call start_response without the exc_info argument if start_response has already been called within the current invocation of the application. This includes the case where the first call to start_response raised an error. (See the example CGI gateway above for an illustration of the correct logic.) 当且仅当提供exc_info参数时，应用可能会调用start_response多次。说得更精确一点，如果start_response应该在当前的应用调用中被调用过了，再次调用时如果不提供exc_info参数就会引发一个致命错误。第一次调用start_response出错也包括在这种情况中。（参见上文的CGI网关示例以领会正确的逻辑流程。）Note: servers, gateways, or middleware implementing start_response should ensure that no reference is held to the exc_info parameter beyond the duration of the function's execution, to avoid creating a circular reference through the traceback and frames involved. The simplest way to do this is something like: 注意，集成了start_response的Web服务器、网关服务器和中间件必须保证在start_response执行期之外的时间内不能访问到exc_info，以避免在追踪和涉及到框架时发生循环引用。最简单的处理方式如下123456def start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info=None): if exc_info: try: # do stuff w/exc_info here finally: exc_info = None # Avoid circular ref.The example CGI gateway provides another illustration of this technique. CGI网关样例程序则提供了另一种处理方法。Handling the Content-Length Header(处理Content-Length头)If the application supplies a Content-Length header, the server should not transmit more bytes to the client than the header allows, and should stop iterating over the response when enough data has been sent, or raise an error if the application tries to write() past that point. (Of course, if the application does not provide enough data to meet its stated Content-Length, the server should close the connection and log or otherwise report the error.) 处理Content-Length头如果应用提供Content-Length包头，Web服务器不应该传送大于该包头指定长度的数据给客户端，而应该在发送了足量数据之后停止对改请求进行迭代，或者在应用尝试在此后调用write()时报错。（当然，如果应用提供的数据量不够Content-Length指定的大小，Web服务器应当关闭此连接或直接报错。）If the application does not supply a Content-Length header, a server or gateway may choose one of several approaches to handling it. The simplest of these is to close the client connection when the response is completed. 如果应用没有提供Content-Length包头，服务端有好几种方法可以处理。最简单的一种是当响应结束后关闭客户端连接。Under some circumstances, however, the server or gateway may be able to either generate a Content-Length header, or at least avoid the need to close the client connection. If the application does not call the write() callable, and returns an iterable whose len() is 1, then the server can automatically determine Content-Length by taking the length of the first bytestring yielded by the iterable. 但是在某些情况下，服务端要么必须自己生成一个Content-Length包头，或者至少避免关闭客户端连接。如果应用没有调用write()函数，且返回一个长度为1的迭代器，服务端应该根据迭代器生成的第一个字节流字符串自动确定Content-Length包头的值。And, if the server and client both support HTTP/1.1 chunked encoding, then the server may use chunked encoding to send a chunk for each write() call or bytestring yielded by the iterable, thus generating a Content-Length header for each chunk. This allows the server to keep the client connection alive, if it wishes to do so. Note that the server must comply fully with RFC 2616 when doing this, or else fall back to one of the other strategies for dealing with the absence of Content-Length. 如果服务端和客户端都支持HTTP/1.1标准中的「整块编码」，则服务端可以使用「整块编码」在每次调用write()或迭代器每生成一个字节流字符串就发送一个数据块，同时为每一个数据块生成一个Content-Length包头。这种方法使服务端能够在需要的情况下保证客户端的连接不断。在采用这种方法时服务端必须遵守RFC2616，否则就只能使用其他方法来处理Content-Length包头缺失的情况。(Note: applications and middleware must not apply any kind of Transfer-Encoding to their output, such as chunking or gzipping; as hop-by-hop operations, these encodings are the province of the actual web server/gateway. See Other HTTP Features below, for more details.) （注意：应用和中间件禁止在各自的输出中使用任何数据编码手段，比如分块或压缩；在进行「逐跳」操作时，这些编码方式是服务端的特权。参见「其他HTTP特性」小节以获取更多细节。）Buffering and Streaming(缓冲和流)Generally speaking, applications will achieve the best throughput by buffering their (modestly-sized) output and sending it all at once. This is a common approach in existing frameworks such as Zope: the output is buffered in a StringIO or similar object, then transmitted all at once, along with the response headers. 缓冲区和流处理一般来说，应用通过缓存适量的数据最后一次输出来达到最佳的吞吐量。这是现有框架比如Zope中常用的技术：输出被缓存在一个StringIO或类似对象中，最后与响应包头一起一次输出。The corresponding approach in WSGI is for the application to simply return a single-element iterable (such as a list) containing the response body as a single bytestring. This is the recommended approach for the vast majority of application functions, that render HTML pages whose text easily fits in memory. WSGI中类似的处理是让应用简单地返回一个包含字节流字符串形式的响应包体的迭代器（比如一个列表）。对于绝大多数渲染数据量很小（足以放在内存中）的HTML页面的应用函数都建议采用这种方法。For large files, however, or for specialized uses of HTTP streaming (such as multipart server push), an application may need to provide output in smaller blocks (e.g. to avoid loading a large file into memory). It's also sometimes the case that part of a response may be time-consuming to produce, but it would be useful to send ahead the portion of the response that precedes it. 但是对于大文件，或对于HTTP流的特殊用途（比如多部件「服务器推送」），应用可以根据需要将输出以小块形式提供（比如为了避免将一个大文件全部加载到内存中）。有时候响应的部分数据生成很耗时，也可以将已经生成的输出提前发送过去。In these cases, applications will usually return an iterator (often a generator-iterator) that produces the output in a block-by-block fashion. These blocks may be broken to coincide with mulitpart boundaries (for server push), or just before time-consuming tasks (such as reading another block of an on-disk file). 在这些情况下，应用经常会返回一个生成迭代器来生成一块一块的输出。这些数据块可以被打散以适应多部件边界（比如「服务器推送」），或者只是在耗时很长的任务之前进行（比如读取另一个在磁盘上的文件数据块）。WSGI servers, gateways, and middleware must not delay the transmission of any block; they must either fully transmit the block to the client, or guarantee that they will continue transmission even while the application is producing its next block. A server/gateway or middleware may provide this guarantee in one of three ways: 遵循WSGI的Web服务器，网关服务器和中间件不能延迟传送任何数据块。它们必须要么将整个数据块传送给客户端，要么保证即使应用在生成下一个数据块的时候它们仍然会继续传输，可以通过以下三种方法提供保证：Send the entire block to the operating system (and request that any O/S buffers be flushed) before returning control to the application, OR 将这个数据块转交给操作系统并请求刷新所有系统缓存。Use a different thread to ensure that the block continues to be transmitted while the application produces the next block. 使用另一个单独的线程保证数据块在应用生成下一个数据块的时候继续传送。(Middleware only) send the entire block to its parent gateway/server 中间件还可以将整个数据块传送给其上层的网关服务器或Web服务器。By providing this guarantee, WSGI allows applications to ensure that transmission will not become stalled at an arbitrary point in their output data. This is critical for proper functioning of e.g. multipart server push streaming, where data between multipart boundaries should be transmitted in full to the client. 通过提供这个保证，WSGI保证数据传送不会再应用输出数据的某个时刻被打断。这对于诸如多部件「服务器推送」输出流之类技术有重要作用，在这些技术中多部件边间之间的数据要求必须完整地传送到客户端。Middleware Handling of Block Boundaries(块边界的中间件处理)In order to better support asynchronous applications and servers, middleware components must not block iteration waiting for multiple values from an application iterable. If the middleware needs to accumulate more data from the application before it can produce any output, it must yield an empty bytestring. 为了更好地支持异步的应用和服务器，中间件不能在等待应用迭代器生成多个值时阻塞迭代。如果中间件需要在应用尚未有输出的时候收集更多数据，则它必须生成一个空的字节流字符串。To put this requirement another way, a middleware component must yield at least one value each time its underlying application yields a value. If the middleware cannot yield any other value, it must yield an empty bytestring. 换言之，每次下层应用产生一个值时中间件都必须相应生成至少一个值。如果中间件不能生成任何有意义的值，则生成一个空的字节流字符串。This requirement ensures that asynchronous applications and servers can conspire to reduce the number of threads that are required to run a given number of application instances simultaneously. 这个规定保证了异步应用和服务器能够合作，以减少同时支持固定数量应用实例所需的线程数量。Note also that this requirement means that middleware must return an iterable as soon as its underlying application returns an iterable. It is also forbidden for middleware to use the write() callable to transmit data that is yielded by an underlying application. Middleware may only use their parent server's write() callable to transmit data that the underlying application sent using a middleware-provided write() callable. 值得注意的是，这要求中间件必须在下层应用返回一个迭代器时也立即向上返回一个迭代器。中间件禁止使用write()可调用者来传送下层应用生成的数据。中间件只能调用上层服务器的write()可调用者来传送下层应用调用中间件自己的write()可调用者生成的数据。The write() Callable(可调用 write())Some existing application framework APIs support unbuffered output in a different manner than WSGI. Specifically, they provide a write function or method of some kind to write an unbuffered block of data, or else they provide a buffered write function and a flush mechanism to flush the buffer. 某些现有框架的API支持无缓冲输出的方法与WSGI不同。尤其是他们提供了某种形式的write函数以无缓冲地写入一个数据块，或者提供了一个有缓冲的write函数和一个flush机制来刷新缓存。Unfortunately, such APIs cannot be implemented in terms of WSGI's iterable application return value, unless threads or other special mechanisms are used. 不幸的是这些API不能使用WSGI应用的迭代器返回值来实现，除非使用多线程或类似的特殊技术。Therefore, to allow these frameworks to continue using an imperative API, WSGI includes a special write() callable, returned by the start_response callable. 因此为了让这些框架继续使用必要的API，WSGI包含了一个特别的write()可调用者，由start_response可调用者返回。New WSGI applications and frameworks should not use the write() callable if it is possible to avoid doing so. The write() callable is strictly a hack to support imperative streaming APIs. In general, applications should produce their output via their returned iterable, as this makes it possible for web servers to interleave other tasks in the same Python thread, potentially providing better throughput for the server as a whole. 新的WSGI应用和框架在不必要的时候不应该使用write()可调用者。write()可调用者是为了支持必要的流式API的一种hack手段。一般而言，应用应该使用迭代器返回输出，这样Web服务器可以在同一个Python线程中交替完成不同的任务，从而潜在地提高服务器的吞吐量。The write() callable is returned by the start_response() callable, and it accepts a single parameter: a bytestring to be written as part of the HTTP response body, that is treated exactly as though it had been yielded by the output iterable. In other words, before write() returns, it must guarantee that the passed-in bytestring was either completely sent to the client, or that it is buffered for transmission while the application proceeds onward. write()可调用者由start_response()可调用者返回，只接受一个参数：作为HTTP包体一部分的一个字节流字符串，并将此字符串当作由输出迭代器生成的。换言之，在write()返回前，必须保证传入的字节流字符串要么被完整地传送到了客户端，或者在应用继续运行的时候已被缓存起来等待传送。An application must return an iterable object, even if it uses write() to produce all or part of its response body. The returned iterable may be empty (i.e. yield no non-empty bytestrings), but if it does yield non-empty bytestrings, that output must be treated normally by the server or gateway (i.e., it must be sent or queued immediately). Applications must not invoke write() from within their return iterable, and therefore any bytestrings yielded by the iterable are transmitted after all bytestrings passed to write() have been sent to the client. 应用必须返回一个迭代器对象，即使它使用了write()来生成全部或者部分的响应包体。返回的迭代器必须为空（即不生成任何非空字节流字符串），但是如果它确实生成了非空字节流字符串，则该输出必须被Web服务器或网关服务器当作一般输出处理（即必须被立即传送或缓存）。应用禁止在其返回的迭代器内部调用write()，因此任何迭代器生成的字节流字符串必须在所有传递给write()的字符串被发送给客户端之后才能进行传送。Unicode Issues(Unicode的问题)HTTP does not directly support Unicode, and neither does this interface. All encoding/decoding must be handled by the application; all strings passed to or from the server must be of type str or bytes, never unicode. The result of using a unicode object where a string object is required, is undefined. HTTP并不直接支持Unicode，WSGI亦然。所有的编码和解码工作由应用自己完成，所有发送给服务器或从服务器接收的字符串必须是str类型或bytes类型的，而不能是unicode类型。在要求使用字符串类型的地方使用unicode类型的结果是不可知的。Note also that strings passed to start_response() as a status or as response headers must follow RFC 2616 with respect to encoding. That is, they must either be ISO-8859-1 characters, or use RFC 2047 MIME encoding. 作为状态或响应包头传递给start_response()的字符串必须遵守RFC2616中关于编码的规定，即要么是ISO-8859-1字符，要么使用RFC2047MIME编码。On Python platforms where the str or StringType type is in fact Unicode-based (e.g. Jython, IronPython, Python 3, etc.), all strings referred to in this specification must contain only code points representable in ISO-8859-1 encoding (\u0000 through \u00FF, inclusive). It is a fatal error for an application to supply strings containing any other Unicode character or code point. Similarly, servers and gateways must not supply strings to an application containing any other Unicode characters. 在str或StringType类型实际上是Unicode编码的Python平台（如Jython，IronPython，Python3等）上，所有对应于本规范的「字符串」只能包含对应于那些ISO-8859-1可表示编码点的Unicode编码（即u0000到u00FF）。应用使用的字符串中包含有其他字符或编码点会引发致命错误。Web服务器和网关服务器也禁止提供包含其他Unicode字符的字符串。Again, all objects referred to in this specification as strings must be of type str or StringType, and must not be of type unicode or UnicodeType. And, even if a given platform allows for more than 8 bits per character in str/StringType objects, only the lower 8 bits may be used, for any value referred to in this specification as a string. 再强调一遍，所有对应到本规范的「字符串」必须是str类型或者StringType类型，而不能是unicode类型或者UnicodeType类型。即使已有的平台允许在str或StringType类型中使用每个字符多于8比特的编码，也只有低8位允许使用。For values referred to in this specification as bytestrings (i.e., values read from wsgi.input, passed to write() or yielded by the application), the value must be of type bytes under Python 3, and str in earlier versions of Python. 本规范中所谓的「字节流字符串」（即从wsgi.input中读入的值，最后会传递给write()或由应用生成），其值必须是Python3下的bytes类型，或者更低版本Python中的str类型。Error Handling(错误处理)In general, applications should try to trap their own, internal errors, and display a helpful message in the browser. (It is up to the application to decide what helpful means in this context.) 一般而言，应用应该自己捕获内部错误，并在浏览器中显示有帮助的错误信息。（由应用自己决定什么叫「有帮助」。）However, to display such a message, the application must not have actually sent any data to the browser yet, or else it risks corrupting the response. WSGI therefore provides a mechanism to either allow the application to send its error message, or be automatically aborted: the exc_info argument to start_response. Here is an example of its use: 但是要显示这条信息，应用在之前必须没有发送任何数据到浏览器，或者可以冒险中断响应。WSGI提供了一个机制以使应用要么能够传送错误信息，要么会被自动终止：通过start_response的exc_info参数。下面有一个例子来阐述其用法：12345678910111213try: # regular application code here status = "200 Froody" response_headers = [("content-type", "text/plain")] start_response(status, response_headers) return ["normal body goes here"]except: # XXX should trap runtime issues like MemoryError, KeyboardInterrupt # in a separate handler before this bare 'except:'... status = "500 Oops" response_headers = [("content-type", "text/plain")] start_response(status, response_headers, sys.exc_info()) return ["error body goes here"]If no output has been written when an exception occurs, the call to start_response will return normally, and the application will return an error body to be sent to the browser. However, if any output has already been sent to the browser, start_response will reraise the provided exception. This exception should not be trapped by the application, and so the application will abort. The server or gateway can then trap this (fatal) exception and abort the response. 如果在异常发生时还没有任何输出，start_response的调用会正常返回，应用会收到可用以传递给浏览器的错误信息。而如果之前有任何输出已经被传递给浏览器，start_response会重新抛出异常。这个异常不能被应用捕获，所以应用不会终止。Web服务器或网关服务器能够捕获这个异常并终止响应。Servers should trap and log any exception that aborts an application or the iteration of its return value. If a partial response has already been written to the browser when an application error occurs, the server or gateway may attempt to add an error message to the output, if the already-sent headers indicate a text/* content type that the server knows how to modify cleanly. 服务器应该捕获并记录所有终止了应用或其返回值迭代过程的异常。如果错误发生时部分响应信息已经被传递给浏览器，Web服务器或网关服务器可以尝试在输出中添加一条错误信息，只要已发送的包头包含服务器可以显式修改的text/*类型内容。Some middleware may wish to provide additional exception handling services, or intercept and replace application error messages. In such cases, middleware may choose to not re-raise the exc_info supplied to start_response, but instead raise a middleware-specific exception, or simply return without an exception after storing the supplied arguments. This will then cause the application to return its error body iterable (or invoke write()), allowing the middleware to capture and modify the error output. These techniques will work as long as application authors: 某些中间件可能希望能够提供其他的错误处理机制，或拦截和替换应用错误信息。在这种情况下，中间件可以选择不重新将exc_info抛出给start_response，但是必须相应地抛出一个中间件特定的异常，或者缓存下提供的参数后简单地正常返回。这迫使应用返回其错误信息迭代器（或调用write()），从而使中间件能够捕获和修改错误信息。这些技术要求开发者遵循如下规范：Always provide exc_info when beginning an error response 开始错误响应时总是提供exc_info参数。Never trap errors raised by start_response when exc_info is being provided 提供了exc_info参数的情况下不要捕获任何由start_response抛出的异常。HTTP 1.1 Expect/Continue(HTTP 1.1预期/继续)Servers and gateways that implement HTTP 1.1 must provide transparent support for HTTP 1.1’s expect/continue mechanism. This may be done in any of several ways: 实现了HTTP1.1标准的Web服务器和网关服务器必须提供HTTP1.1标准中「expect/continue」机制的透明支持。这可以通过以下方法做到：Respond to requests containing an Expect: 100-continue request with an immediate 100 Continue response, and proceed normally. 对于任何「Expect:100-continue」的请求返回一个即时的「100Continue」响应，然后正常继续运行。Proceed with the request normally, but provide the application with a wsgi.input stream that will send the 100 Continue response if/when the application first attempts to read from the input stream. The read request must then remain blocked until the client responds. 继续正常运行，但是提供给应用一个wsgi.input流，这个流会在应用第一次尝试读取输入流的时候发送「100Continue」响应。读请求之后必须阻塞，直到客户端响应为止。Wait until the client decides that the server does not support expect/continue, and sends the request body on its own. (This is suboptimal, and is not recommended.) 阻塞请求直到客户端意识到服务器不支持expect/continue机制，然后自己发送请求包体。（这种方法不是最优的，不推荐使用。）Note that these behavior restrictions do not apply for HTTP 1.0 requests, or for requests that are not directed to an application object. For more information on HTTP 1.1 Expect/Continue, see RFC 2616, sections 8.2.3 and 10.1.1. 注意：这些限制并不针对HTTP1.0的请求，也不适用于不传递给应用对象的请求。参见RFC26168.2.3小节和10.1.1小节以获取更多关于HTTP1.1Expect/Continue请求的信息。Other HTTP Features(其他HTTP特性)In general, servers and gateways should play dumb and allow the application complete control over its output. They should only make changes that do not alter the effective semantics of the application's response. It is always possible for the application developer to add middleware components to supply additional features, so server/gateway developers should be conservative in their implementation. In a sense, a server should consider itself to be like an HTTP gateway server, with the application being an HTTP origin server. (See RFC 2616, section 1.3, for the definition of these terms.) 其他HTTP特性一般来说，服务端应该让应用全权负责控制自己的输出。服务端只能进行不影响应用响应语义的改动。应用开发者总是可以通过添加中间件来提供附件特性，因此服务端开发者在实现过程中必须尽可能保守。从某种意义上来说，Web服务器应当视自己为HTTP「网关服务器」，而将应用看成一个HTTP的「源服务器」。（参见RFC26161.3小节获取更多信息。）However, because WSGI servers and applications do not communicate via HTTP, what RFC 2616 calls hop-by-hop headers do not apply to WSGI internal communications. WSGI applications must not generate any hop-by-hop headers, attempt to use HTTP features that would require them to generate such headers, or rely on the content of any incoming hop-by-hop headers in the environ dictionary. WSGI servers must handle any supported inbound hop-by-hop headers on their own, such as by decoding any inbound Transfer-Encoding, including chunked encoding if applicable. 但是因为WSGI服务端和应用端不通过HTTP交互，所以RFC2616称之为「逐跳」包头的特性不适用与WSGI的内部通信。WSGI应用不能生成任何「逐跳」包头[7]，不能使用任何需要生成该包头的HTTP特性，也不能依赖于environ字典中的任何传入的「逐跳」包头。WSGI服务端必须自己处理任何传入的能够支持的「逐跳」包头，比如对传入的Transfer-Encoding进行解码，如果可能的话其中也包括整块编码。Applying these principles to a variety of HTTP features, it should be clear that a server may handle cache validation via the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since request headers and the Last-Modified and ETag response headers. However, it is not required to do this, and the application should perform its own cache validation if it wants to support that feature, since the server/gateway is not required to do such validation. 以上的原则适用于很多HTTP特性，服务端可以通过If-None-Match和If-Modified-Since请求包头以及Last-Modified和ETag响应包头来处理缓存生效的问题。但是这并不是必要的，应用如果想支持该特性应该自己处理自己的缓存生效问题，因为服务端不一定会处理。Similarly, a server may re-encode or transport-encode an application's response, but the application should use a suitable content encoding on its own, and must not apply a transport encoding. A server may transmit byte ranges of the application's response if requested by the client, and the application doesn't natively support byte ranges. Again, however, the application should perform this function on its own if desired. 类似情况比如服务端可以对应用的响应进行重新编码或传输编码，但是应用应该自己选择一个合适的内容编码方式，并且禁止使用传输编码。服务端可以在客户端要求的时候传输应用响应的字节范围（？），而应用并不原生支持字节范围，但是同样的，应用应该在有需求时自己干这个。Note that these restrictions on applications do not necessarily mean that every application must reimplement every HTTP feature; many HTTP features can be partially or fully implemented by middleware components, thus freeing both server and application authors from implementing the same features over and over again. 请注意，这些限制条件并不是要求应用把每一个HTTP特性都自己重新实现一遍。很多特性可以部分或全部被中间件实现，从而避免服务端和应用端的开发者一次又一次地重复实现同样的特性。Thread Support(线程的支持)Thread support, or lack thereof, is also server-dependent. Servers that can run multiple requests in parallel, should also provide the option of running an application in a single-threaded fashion, so that applications or frameworks that are not thread-safe may still be used with that server. 线程机制的支持与否取决与各Web服务器自身。可以并行处理多个请求的服务器，必须提供单线程运行应用的选项，以使非线程安全的应用或框架仍然能够在其上运行。Implementation/Application Notes(实现/应用笔记)Server Extension APIs(服务器扩展接口)Some server authors may wish to expose more advanced APIs, that application or framework authors can use for specialized purposes. For example, a gateway based on mod_python might wish to expose part of the Apache API as a WSGI extension. 一些服务端开发者希望暴露更多的高级API，以使应用端开发者用来实现特殊的需求。比如说一个基于mod_python的网关服务器会希望以WSGI扩展的方式暴露部分Apache的API。In the simplest case, this requires nothing more than defining an environ variable, such as mod_python.some_api. But, in many cases, the possible presence of middleware can make this difficult. For example, an API that offers access to the same HTTP headers that are found in environ variables, might return different data if environ has been modified by middleware. 在最简单的情况下，这只要求定义一个environ变量，比如mod_python.some_api。但是很多时候可能存在的中间件会使情况变得复杂起来。比如一个environ变量中提供访问某个HTTP包头功能的API，可能在environ被中间件修改之后返回不同的值。In general, any extension API that duplicates, supplants, or bypasses some portion of WSGI functionality runs the risk of being incompatible with middleware components. Server/gateway developers should not assume that nobody will use middleware, because some framework developers specifically intend to organize or reorganize their frameworks to function almost entirely as middleware of various kinds. 一般而言，任何复制、补足或绕过了部分WSGI功能的API都有与中间件不兼容的危险。服务端开发者不应该假设没有使用中间件，因为某些框架开发者尤其希望将他们的框架设计或重构成类似中间件的样子。So, to provide maximum compatibility, servers and gateways that provide extension APIs that replace some WSGI functionality, must design those APIs so that they are invoked using the portion of the API that they replace. For example, an extension API to access HTTP request headers must require the application to pass in its current environ, so that the server/gateway may verify that HTTP headers accessible via the API have not been altered by middleware. If the extension API cannot guarantee that it will always agree with environ about the contents of HTTP headers, it must refuse service to the application, e.g. by raising an error, returning None instead of a header collection, or whatever is appropriate to the API. 所以为了提供最大程度的兼容性，提供扩展API以取代某些WSGI功能的服务端应该精心设计，以使它们在被调用时使用了这些扩展API。举例来说，一个访问HTTP请求包头的API必须要求应用传递其当前的environ，以使服务端能确定通过该API能访问到的HTTP包头没有被中间件修改。如果扩展API不能保证其对HTTP包头的要求与environ一致，那么它必须通过报错、返回None而不是包头集合或任何其他合适的方式拒绝为应用服务。Similarly, if an extension API provides an alternate means of writing response data or headers, it should require the start_response callable to be passed in, before the application can obtain the extended service. If the object passed in is not the same one that the server/gateway originally supplied to the application, it cannot guarantee correct operation and must refuse to provide the extended service to the application. 类似的例子还有如果扩展API提供写入响应数据或包头的功能，它必须要求应用在使用扩展功能之前传入start_response可调用者。如果该可调用者与服务端最早从应用那儿收到的不一致，那么该API便不能保证正确的响应，只能拒绝为应用提供改扩展服务。These guidelines also apply to middleware that adds information such as parsed cookies, form variables, sessions, and the like to environ. Specifically, such middleware should provide these features as functions which operate on environ, rather than simply stuffing values into environ. This helps ensure that information is calculated from environ after any middleware has done any URL rewrites or other environ modifications. 这些指导原则也适用于在environ中额外添加了类似解析过的cookie、构造变量、会话等内容的中间件。尤其是那些将这些功能以作用于environ的函数形式提供的中间件，相比简单将数据插入environ中的中间件更要注意。这保证了在每次中间件对environ进行了URL重写或其他修改之后environ中的信息都会被检查一遍。It is very important that these safe extension rules be followed by both server/gateway and middleware developers, in order to avoid a future in which middleware developers are forced to delete any and all extension APIs from environ to ensure that their mediation isn't being bypassed by applications using those extensions! 这些「安全扩展」的原则非常重要，服务端和应用端开发者都应该遵守，以避免未来的某个时候中间件开发者不得不删除某些或全部涉及environ的扩展API，以免中间件的功能因为应用调用了扩展API而失效。Application Configuration(应用程序配置)This specification does not define how a server selects or obtains an application to invoke. These and other configuration options are highly server-specific matters. It is expected that server/gateway authors will document how to configure the server to execute a particular application object, and with what options (such as threading options). 本规范并没有定义服务端如何选择或获取一个应用来调用。这些以及其他的配置选项是由服务端根据自己的特定情况决定的。服务端开发者应该在自述文档中记述如何配置才能以特定的选项（如线程选项）执行一个特定的应用程序对象。Framework authors, on the other hand, should document how to create an application object that wraps their framework's functionality. The user, who has chosen both the server and the application framework, must connect the two together. However, since both the framework and the server now have a common interface, this should be merely a mechanical matter, rather than a significant engineering effort for each new server/framework pair. 另一方面，框架开发者应该在自述文档中记载如何创建一个包含框架功能的应用对象。在服务端和应用端都使用了框架的用户必须将二者结合起来考虑。但是由于双方现在都有通用接口了，这只是个体力活儿，而不是一个重要的工程难题。Finally, some applications, frameworks, and middleware may wish to use the environ dictionary to receive simple string configuration options. Servers and gateways should support this by allowing an application's deployer to specify name-value pairs to be placed in environ. In the simplest case, this support can consist merely of copying all operating system-supplied environment variables from os.environ into the environ dictionary, since the deployer in principle can configure these externally to the server, or in the CGI case they may be able to be set via the server's configuration files. 最后，有些应用、框架和中间件希望使用environ字典来收取简单的配置选项字符串。Web服务器和网关服务器应该通过允许应用开发者在environ中指定键值对来支持这个特性。最简单的情况下，只需要从os.environ中拷贝所有操作系统提供的环境变量到environ字典中即可，因为部署人员原则上能够在服务器上手工配置这些变量，或者在CGI环境下他们可以通过服务器的配置文件来完成。Applications should try to keep such required variables to a minimum, since not all servers will support easy configuration of them. Of course, even in the worst case, persons deploying an application can create a script to supply the necessary configuration values: 应用应该尽量少使用这些变量，因为不是所有的服务器都能够很方便地配置它们。当然，即使在最坏的情况下，部署应用的人也能够通过创建一个脚本提供必要配置选项：12345from the_app import applicationdef new_app(environ, start_response): environ['the_app.configval1'] = 'something' return application(environ, start_response)But, most existing applications and frameworks will probably only need a single configuration value from environ, to indicate the location of their application or framework-specific configuration file(s). (Of course, applications should cache such configuration, to avoid having to re-read it upon each invocation.) 但是大部分的应用和框架可能只需要environ中的一个配置域来显示应用或框架用到的配置文件路径。（当然，应用可以缓存这些配置来避免在每次调用中都读一遍。）URL Reconstruction(URL重建)If an application wishes to reconstruct a request's complete URL, it may do so using the following algorithm, contributed by Ian Bicking: 如果应用希望重建一个请求的完整URL，可以通过下面由IanBicking提供的算法来实现：12345678910111213141516171819from urllib.parse import quoteurl = environ['wsgi.url_scheme']+'://'if environ.get('HTTP_HOST'): url += environ['HTTP_HOST']else: url += environ['SERVER_NAME'] if environ['wsgi.url_scheme'] == 'https': if environ['SERVER_PORT'] != '443': url += ':' + environ['SERVER_PORT'] else: if environ['SERVER_PORT'] != '80': url += ':' + environ['SERVER_PORT']url += quote(environ.get('SCRIPT_NAME', ''))url += quote(environ.get('PATH_INFO', ''))if environ.get('QUERY_STRING'): url += '?' + environ['QUERY_STRING']Note that such a reconstructed URL may not be precisely the same URI as requested by the client. Server rewrite rules, for example, may have modified the client's originally requested URL to place it in a canonical form. 注意重建出来的URL可能不是客户端请求的那个URI，比如服务器重写规则可能会修改客户端请求的原始URL以使其符合规范。Supporting Older (&lt;2.2) Versions of Python(支持更早版本(&lt;2.2)的Python)Some servers, gateways, or applications may wish to support older (＜2.2) versions of Python. This is especially important if Jython is a target platform, since as of this writing a production-ready version of Jython 2.2 is not yet available. 支持低于2.2版本的Python某些Web服务器、网关服务器或者应用可能会需要支持低于2.2版本的Python。在使用Jython作为平台的时候这一点尤其重要，因为高于2.2版本的Jython还不能在生产环境中应用。For servers and gateways, this is relatively straightforward: servers and gateways targeting pre-2.2 versions of Python must simply restrict themselves to using only a standard for loop to iterate over any iterable returned by an application. This is the only way to ensure source-level compatibility with both the pre-2.2 iterator protocol (discussed further below) and today's iterator protocol (see PEP 234). 对于Web服务器和网关服务器，这种支持相对直接：目标平台是低于2.2版本的Python的服务器和网关只能使用一个标准的for循环来迭代任何应用返回的迭代器。这是唯一保证各版本间的迭代器协议在源码级兼容的方法，后面我们会详细讨论。（最新的迭代器协议见PEP234。）(Note that this technique necessarily applies only to servers, gateways, or middleware that are written in Python. Discussion of how to use iterator protocol(s) correctly from other languages is outside the scope of this PEP.) （注意这个技术只适用于Python下的Web服务器、网关服务器和中间件。其他语言中的迭代器协议如何正确使用超出了本规范的讨论范围。）For applications, supporting pre-2.2 versions of Python is slightly more complex: 对于应用程序，支持低于2.2版本的Python有一点麻烦：You may not return a file object and expect it to work as an iterable, since before Python 2.2, files were not iterable. (In general, you shouldn't do this anyway, because it will perform quite poorly most of the time!) Use wsgi.file_wrapper or an application-specific file wrapper class. (See Optional Platform-Specific File Handling for more on wsgi.file_wrapper, and an example class you can use to wrap a file as an iterable.) 你不能返回一个文件对象并期望它像一个迭代器一样工作，因为从Python2.2开始文件就不是迭代器了。（一般而言你也不应该使用这种方法，因为绝大多数情况下这是一种丑陋的实现！）应该使用wsgi.file_wrapper或者应用指定的文件包装器。（参见（可选）特定平台上的文件处理小节以获取更多文件包装器的信息，以及一个可以用来将文件包装为迭代器的样例类。If you return a custom iterable, it must implement the pre-2.2 iterator protocol. That is, provide a __getitem__ method that accepts an integer key, and raises IndexError when exhausted. (Note that built-in sequence types are also acceptable, since they also implement this protocol.) 如果你返回一个经过定制的迭代器，它必须实现2.2版本之前的迭代器协议。亦即提供一个__getitem__方法，这个方法接受一个整数键值，当该值耗尽时就会抛出IndexError异常。（内建的序列类型也是可接受的，因为它们已经集成了相关协议。）Finally, middleware that wishes to support pre-2.2 versions of Python, and iterates over application return values or itself returns an iterable (or both), must follow the appropriate recommendations above. 最后，希望支持低于2.2版本的Python且迭代应用返回值或本身返回一个迭代器的中间件必须遵守以上提到的相应的推荐方法。(Note: It should go without saying that to support pre-2.2 versions of Python, any server, gateway, application, or middleware must also use only language features available in the target version, use 1 and 0 instead of True and False, etc.) （注意：Web服务器、网关服务器、应用或者中间件在支持低于2.2版本的Python都必须只使用该版本支持的特性，比如使用1和0来代替True和False等。）Optional Platform-Specific File Handling(可选的特定于平台的文件处理)Some operating environments provide special high-performance file- transmission facilities, such as the Unix sendfile() call. Servers and gateways may expose this functionality via an optional wsgi.file_wrapper key in the environ. An application may use this file wrapper to convert a file or file-like object into an iterable that it then returns, e.g.: 某些操作系统提供特殊的高性能文件传输功能，比如Unix的sendfile()系统调用。Web服务器和网关服务器可以通过environ中可选的wsgi.file_wrapper域值来提供此功能。应用可以使用这种「文件包装器」来将一个文件或类文件对象转换为一个迭代器并返回，如下所示：1234if 'wsgi.file_wrapper' in environ: return environ['wsgi.file_wrapper'](filelike, block_size)else: return iter(lambda: filelike.read(block_size), '')If the server or gateway supplies wsgi.file_wrapper, it must be a callable that accepts one required positional parameter, and one optional positional parameter. The first parameter is the file-like object to be sent, and the second parameter is an optional block size suggestion (which the server/gateway need not use). The callable must return an iterable object, and must not perform any data transmission until and unless the server/gateway actually receives the iterable as a return value from the application. (To do otherwise would prevent middleware from being able to interpret or override the response data.) 如果Web服务器或网关服务器支持wsgi.file_wrapper，则它必须是一个可调用者，接收一个必须的形式参数和一个可选的形式参数。第一个形式参数是一个待发送的类文件对象，第二个可选的则是一个建议的块大小（服务端不一定要采纳）。这个可调用者必须返回一个迭代对象，并且禁止在服务端实际接收到该迭代器返回值之前传送任何数据。（不这样做的话会妨碍中间件对响应数据进行译码或修改。）To be considered file-like, the object supplied by the application must have a read() method that takes an optional size argument. It may have a close() method, and if so, the iterable returned by wsgi.file_wrapper must have a close() method that invokes the original file-like object's close() method. If the file-like object has any other methods or attributes with names matching those of Python built-in file objects (e.g. fileno()), the wsgi.file_wrapper may assume that these methods or attributes have the same semantics as those of a built-in file object. 为了被看做一个文件，应用提供的对象必须有一个能接受一个可选文件大小参数的read()方法。该对象也可以有一个close()方法，如果提供了这个方法，wsgi.file_wrapper返回的迭代器就必须提供一个close()方法，这个方法最终调用了对象提供的close()方法。如果该对象提供了任何与Python内建文件对象名字一样的方法或属性（比如fileno()），wsgi.file_wrapper可以假设这些方法和属性与它们作为内建的方法和属性时语义相同。The actual implementation of any platform-specific file handling must occur after the application returns, and the server or gateway checks to see if a wrapper object was returned. (Again, because of the presence of middleware, error handlers, and the like, it is not guaranteed that any wrapper created will actually be used.) 任何平台相关的文件处理必须是现在应用返回之后，并且由Web服务器和网关服务器来检查包装器对象是否返回了。（再强调一遍，由于中间件、错误处理程序之类的存在，并不保证包装器被创建了就一定会被使用。）Apart from the handling of close(), the semantics of returning a file wrapper from the application should be the same as if the application had returned iter(filelike.read, ). In other words, transmission should begin at the current position within the file at the time that transmission begins, and continue until the end is reached, or until Content-Length bytes have been written. (If the application doesn't supply a Content-Length, the server may generate one from the file using its knowledge of the underlying file implementation.) 除了对于close()的处理，应用返回文件包装器的语义应该与应用返回iter(filelike.read,‘’)一样。换言之，数据传输应该从当前的文件读写指针位置开始，直到到达文件尾或者达到Content-Length要求的字节数。（如果应用没有提供Content-Length包头，服务端可以根据自己的文件实现机制对具体的文件生成一个。）Of course, platform-specific file transmission APIs don't usually accept arbitrary file-like objects. Therefore, a wsgi.file_wrapper has to introspect the supplied object for things such as a fileno() (Unix-like OSes) or a java.nio.FileChannel (under Jython) in order to determine if the file-like object is suitable for use with the platform-specific API it supports. 当然，平台相关的文件传送API一般不会随便接受一个类文件对象。因此wsgi.file_wrapper必须自己检查所提供的对象有没有诸如fileno()（在Unix类系统上）或java.nio.FileChannel（在Jython平台上）之类的东西，以保证类文件对象正确使用了平台特有的API。Note that even if the object is not suitable for the platform API, the wsgi.file_wrapper must still return an iterable that wraps read() and close(), so that applications using file wrappers are portable across platforms. Here's a simple platform-agnostic file wrapper class, suitable for old (pre 2.2) and new Pythons alike: 另外要注意的是即使该对象不适应平台特有的API，wsgi.file_wrapper也必须返回一个包装了read()和close()的迭代器，以使使用文件包装器的应用能够跨平台移植。下面有一个简单的不依赖特定平台的文件包装器类，适用于所有版本的Python：12345678910111213class FileWrapper: def __init__(self, filelike, blksize=8192): self.filelike = filelike self.blksize = blksize if hasattr(filelike, 'close'): self.close = filelike.close def __getitem__(self, key): data = self.filelike.read(self.blksize) if data: return data raise IndexErrorand here is a snippet from a server/gateway that uses it to provide access to a platform-specific API: 下面一段代码是从服务端代码中抽出来的，支持访问平台相关的API：12345678910111213141516environ['wsgi.file_wrapper'] = FileWrapperresult = application(environ, start_response)try: if isinstance(result, FileWrapper): # check if result.filelike is usable w/platform-specific # API, and if so, use that API to transmit the result. # If not, fall through to normal iterable handling # loop below. for data in result: # etc.finally: if hasattr(result, 'close'): result.close()]]></content>

In developing and supporting your position,you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold ture andexplain how these considerations shape your position.Puzzled by perplexing paintings, we are nevertheless enamored by a painter's impressive strokes. 尽管曾经为一些费解的画作感到困惑，但我们仍会爱上画家独到的笔触。尽管曾经为一些费解的画作感到困惑，但我们仍会爱上画家独到的笔触。And while the meaning of a poem may elude us, its emotional expression does not pale. 尽管诗歌的意义有时让我们难以理解，但它的情绪影响力并不会因此而失色。Such ambiguity in comprehensibility and complexity of art constantly occurs in various art works. 这种艺术创作中“理解的模糊性”与“内涵的复杂性”在许多作品中都有呈现。While the author declares art's intelligibility to be paramount, I appreciate obscure art work as well. 尽管作者称艺术创作中的“浅显易懂”最为重要，但与此同时，我也不得不强调“模糊朦胧”的艺术价值The seeming obscureness actually mirrors the artists' dignity as well as the affluence of both the expression and representation of the artists' mental worlds. 事实上，这种表面上的“模糊性”恰好能够体现作品的脱俗品质以及作者对自我精神世界的丰富表达。All of these characteristics contribute to the irreplaceable merits of art. 所有这些品质构成了艺术作品的不可被取代的优点。I have to admit, on the one hand, that lucidity abounds in a great amount of popular artwork, from a Hollywood action movie to a catchy street song. 然而，从另一个角度来看，我必须承认“浅显易懂”这个优点存在于大量的流行作品中——从好莱坞的动作电影到朗朗上口的街头歌谣。Thanks to the work's clarity in terms of content and expression, people come to know it, accept it and finally, are inclined to spread it. 由于作品在内容的和表达方面上存在的“浅显易懂”的优势，人们很快就能够理解、接受并且乐意将其推广开来。This characteristic of being understandable enables artwork, which used to be exclusive to the noble and upper class, to flourish in public and thereby attain fresh significance in modern society. 这种便于理解的优势将那些曾经被贵族和上流社会所专享的艺术作品带入公众视野，它们在经历繁荣发展的同时并开始在现代社会中取得显著地位。Artists, however, do not always have to pander to the market, sometimes even at the cost of sacrificing art's integrity and uniqueness. 不过，艺术家们一直不太可能去迎合市场的口味，更不可能为此去牺牲作品的艺术追求与独特性。Neither is it possible that every single individual would have an equal aesthetic appreciation of the works created by a great master with peerless skills and special personal experience. 同样不可能的还有，面对这些承载着超凡技艺和独特个人经历的伟大作品，不同的受众能具有相同的审美品位。While I cannot turn a blind eye to copious popular movies, songs and TV shows which emphasis the market over grace and elusiveness, I am hesitant to hastily generalize all kinds of art in the same way. 尽管我无法回避这样一个事实：那些信奉“市场重于高雅和模糊性”的流行电影、歌曲和电视剧正在不断获得更多的关注，但我们很难认同这种视图“将所有艺术归为一类”的做法。Pandering to the public may gain handsome profits for a while, but the resulting artwork will soon lose its value due to the absence of enduring attraction. 过度迎合市场需求在短时间内固然可以带来可观的收益，但放弃对创作风格的坚守将导致作者失去其一贯的吸引力，进而导致作品中的核心价值的丧失。For supporting examples, let us turn to popular artwork: an album with a flamboyant cover, or a film lavishly decorated with advanced visual technology. 拿流行艺术品举例：一张有着花哨外观的唱片，或者一部充斥着先进视觉技术的华丽电影。Have they gained enviable popularity in the public? Possibly. 它们可以获得可观的流行度吗？有可能。Has their adulatory catering to the public taste earned them abiding merits? Hardly. 但是，它们对市场的需求的一味迎合就能够帮助他们取得持续的优势吗？不太可能。The very fact that these music and film companies must conjure up various new productions one after another ironically reveals the producers' awareness of the evanescent value of their works and their trepidation of losing the market due to such fleeting value. 讽刺的是，这些唱片公司和电影公司必须不断推出新产品的行为恰好反映了他们深知这些作品价值匮乏，以及对因此而被市场淘汰的担忧。More importantly, the possession of merit does not necessarily require artwork to be intelligible. 更为重要的是，想要获得艺术价值，并不意味着必须使作品简单易懂。In fact, art's merit is primarily embodied in the artist's skill mastery, as well as by the representation of his or her inner world. 事实上，作品的价值主要体现在艺术家的高超技艺以及其内心世界的生动呈现。Such skills frequently remain exclusive to the artist due to its opaqueness; likewise, the artist's unique personal experience also alienates him or her from those who do not share similar stories. 而由于其专业性，这些技巧很难被普通大众所理解；同样，作者特有的人生经历也疏远了那些缺乏类似经历的受众。The artwork, therefore, is not always understandable to most people, but under no circumstance does this complexity hinder the artwork from achieving its intrinsic worth. 因此，艺术作品并不总能被大部分人所理解；但可以确定的是，这种复杂性并不会阻碍作品实现其内在价值。Picasso's Guerica, one of many possible examples, sufficiently supports my claim. 比如，毕加索的《格尔尼卡》就可以很好地佐证我的观点。Prestigious for its adept expression of cubism and surrealism, as well as its vivid portrayal of the painter's mental agony and fury about violence, Guerica has achieved worldwide fame. 由于对立体主义与超现实主义的娴熟运用，以及作者生动地呈现了面对暴利时的痛苦与愤怒，《格尔尼卡》在世界范围内赢得了广泛美誉。However, the abstruseness of this work's expression precludes common appreciation; similarly, people with no experience under the devil's trample fail to sympathize with the painter. 但是，作品的复杂却让大众难以理解；未能亲历邪恶势力折磨的观众也难以切身体会作者的创作背景。Nevertheless, few dispute Guerica's arcane expression and theme, but applaud it as a highly meritorious masterpiece 然而，《格尔尼卡》并未因其“模糊朦脓”的表达方式与主题而受到诟病；相反，人们丢次纷纷给予了极高的赞许。To summarize, while we may fell a sense of closeness with the artist when previously elusive artwork becomes accessible, such a switch in most scenarios takes place at the expense of art's integrity. To gain a better understanding of art, we should better foster our aesthetic appreciation, rather than juvenilely demanding the convergence of elegance and mediocrity. People’s Behavior - Forces or Own Making? - 11Free willPeople’s behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statementand explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position,you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold ture andexplain how these considerations shape your position.Human behaviors are interesting in that they can either be spontaneous or driven by external forces. 人类的行为是很有趣的，因为他们的行为可能是是自发的、可能是由外力驱动的。Opinions vary greatly regarding the importance of these factories. 人们对这些因素的重要性持有不同的看法。The statement suggests that our behaviors are largely determined by external forces rather than our own qulities. 题干认为我们的行为很大程度上是由外力而不是我们自身的素质所决定的。While it may be true that external forces can greatly shape our behavior, from my perspective, our own making also plays a role that cannot be overlooked. 虽然外力可以大大塑造我们的行为的观点可能是正确的，但在我看来，我们自身的内在作用也发挥着不可忽视的作用。What is more, since external and internal forces have distinct natures and mechanisms to affect human behaviors, any attempt to claim one is more influential than the other is overly simplistic. 更为重要的是，因为外部和内部力量的本质以及它们影响人类行为的机制截然不同，任何试图宣称一种力量比另一种力量更有影响力的人都过度简化了问题。External forces can play a critical role in regulating human behavior, because human beings are social animals and respond to external stimuli. 外部力量在控制人类行为中可能发挥了关键作用，因为人类是社会性动物，会对外部刺激作出反应。Therefore, social norms determine to a large extent what can be or cannot be done. 因此，社会规范很大程度上决定了什么能做，什么不能做。The reason why humans are a social species can be traced back to ancient times, when individuals were vulnerable to nature's elements. 人类是一种社会性物种的原因可以追溯到古代，那时个人很容易受到自然因素的影响。When they acted collectively, however, humans became much stronger which substantially increased their chance of survival. 然而，当他们集体行动时，人类变得更为强大，这大大增加了他们的生存几率。Over time, being a part of a group or tribe became a survival advantage, with banishment often equaling demise. 随着时间的推移，加入一个群体或部落成为了生存优势，被放逐往往意味着死亡。In the sense, one would face the risk of perishing alone if he or she defied social norms. 在这个意义上，一个人如果违背社会规范，就会面临孤立的风险。Even though modern tools have drastically increased the odds of survival, we are still emotionally attached to society, the modern tribe we belong to, and yearn for social recognition. 即使现代工具已经大大增加了生存的几率，我们在感情上仍然依附于社会——我们所属的现代部落——并渴望获得社会认可。Some of our basic motivations, such as aspiring to become wealthy, beautiful, intelligent, or powerful, can be explained by this desire. 这一渴望可以解释我们的一些基本动机，如渴望变得富有、美丽、聪明或强大。The yearning also prevents us from behaving outside of socially acceptable norms. 这种渴望也阻止了我们进行不被社会规范所接受的行为。That being said, I must point out that humans are mentally capable of making choices of their own will and physically capable of executing these choices. 话虽如此，我必须指出人类在精神上有能力处于自己的意愿作出选择，在肉体上有能力执行这些选择。This is particularly true when our choices involve little, if any, interaction with the external environment. 当我们的选择同外在环境几乎没有关系（或只有恨少的关系）时，这一点尤其正确。In this case, our choices do not conflict with societal guidelines. 在这种情况下，我们的选择并不会和社会准则产生冲突。If one wants to pick up a restaurant for dinner in the Midtown of New York City, for example, there are many choices his or her disposal: French, Asian, American, and Mexican and so on. 例如，如果一个人想在纽约市中心地区找一家餐馆吃晚饭，会有多种选择任他/她挑选：法国菜、亚洲菜、美国菜、墨西哥菜等等。This choice is not determined by external factors, but rather depends oa a person's own will. 这种选择不是由外部因素决定的，而是取决于一个人的个人意志。Examples like these suggest that when ur behavior has little to do with our social environment, we can and will make choices that reflect our own volition. 这样的例子表明当我们的行为和社会环境无关时，我们可以并愿意做出能反映我们自身意愿的选择。From the discussion above, it is clear that external and internal forces are capable of determining human behavior, and most of the time we cannot disregard either's influence. 我上面的讨论可以清楚地看出，外部和内部力量都能决定人的行为，大多数时候我们不能忽视任何一方的影响力。But neither can we compare their importance. 但我们也无法比较它们的重要性。In some cases, external forces determine what needs to be done but we ultimately decide how to behave while adhering to social norms 在某些情况下，外部力量决定了我们需要做什么，但在遵守社会规范的同时最终决定任何行事的人还是我们自己。For instance, a scientist will be forced to secure funding if his or her laboratory faces financial hardship. 例如，当一个科学家的实验室面临财务困难时，他/她会被迫寻求资金。Though this necessity is solely determined by external forces, how best to secure those funds is at the scientist's discretion: he or she can seek federal support or form a collaborative relationship with industry. 虽然这种需求完全由外部力量决定，但任何更好地获取资金是由科学家自行决定的：他/她可以寻求联邦政府的支持，或和工业界建立合作关系。Either way, his or her action is not influenced by external factors. 无论采取哪种方式，他/她的行为都不只受到外在因素影响。How external and internal forces can jointly shape human behavior has been demonstrated from different perspectives in this response. 本文从不同角度证明了外部和内部力量如何共同塑造人类的行为。External forces offer us challenges and stipulate rules which must be followed but solutions are based on internal factors. 外部力量提供了挑战、规定了必须遵守的规则，但解决方案是基于内部因素的。This makes it difficult to argue that external forces play a more significant role in determining people's behavior. 这使得我们很难认为外部力量在决定人类行为中起着更为重要的作用。2To sum up, I have demonstrated that both external and internal forces are capable of determining people's behavior. Given the different mechanisms through which external and internal forces shape how we behave, conclusions drawn from a hasty comparison would certainly be oversimplified. More Knowledge, More Comprehension? - 33越学习，越发现自己的无知。笛卡尔As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensive, but more complex and mysterious.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statementand explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position,you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold ture andexplain how these considerations shape your position.Since the first human gazed up at the night sky, human beings have never stopped acquiring knowledge and attempting to understand the surrounding world. However, there is a claim that as people gain more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible but rather more complex and mysterious. I believe that knowledge does not make things more complex but rather reshapes our perception. However, in the process of acquiring knowledge, some things can become more comprehensible while new mystery emerges. There is a difference between complexity and incomprehensibility. 复杂性和不可理解性是不同的。Although it is undeniably more challenging to understand a complicated object, being difficult to grasp does not necessarily mean that it is impossible to comprehend. 虽然外面不能否认理解复杂的对象更具有挑战性，但难以理解并不一定意味着不能理解。Has the world become more complex as we come to know more of it? I doubt this is the case, because the world's complexity does not depend on our comprehension level. 因为我们了解更多，所以世界变得更加复杂了吗？我对这种说法存疑，因为世界的复杂性并不取决于我们的理解水平。For example, rules governing the movements of stars have been always the same, from the time of the first stargazer, but our understanding of these laws has improved. 例如，自第一位占星师所在的时代起，星球运动的规则始终如一，但我们对这些规律的理解却进步了。Reductionists may argue that knowledge simplifies our understanding but this view does not always hold true because we have not discovered every piece of information about the physical world. 还原主义者可能会说知识简化了我们的理解，但这一观点并不总是正确的，因为我们并没有发现有关物理世界的每一条信息。That is, as people acquire more knowledge, new information emerge which makes things more complex to them. 也就是说，当人们获得了更多的知识，新的信息出现会让事物变得更加复杂。As mentioned above, incomprehensibility does not arise from complexity. 如上所述，不可理解性并不来自于复杂性。The question about whether the world becomes incomprehensible in light of new knowledge therefore requires additional discussion. 因此，关于世界是否因为新知识而变得不可理解的问题还需要进一步讨论。Due to the disparate nature of different things, it would be an oversimplification to claim that new knowledge makes things more mysterious. 由于不同的“事物”具有截然不同的性质，宣称新知识会让事物更为神秘是一种过度简化。New knowledge endows us with powerful tools with which to examine the things around us. 新知识为我们提供了强大的工具来考察我们周遭的事物。For instance, advancements in laser technology, benefiting from new optic knowledge, have given us new information about biological process in human body and shed light on the mechanism of chemical reactions on an unprecedented microscopic level. 例如，受益于新的光学知识而进步的激光技术让我们了解了人体中的生物过程，并在前所未有的微观水平上阐明了化学反应的机制。Thus, many biological and chemical processes that used t be mysteries are no comprehensible to us. 因此，我们现在可以理解许多一度难以理解的生物和化学过程。On the other hand, new knowledge often raises new questions which cannot be answered without further inquiry. 另一方面，新知识常常引发新的问题，如果没有进一步探究我们就无法回答这些问题。Those questions may seem to be mysterious at first glance. 这些问题乍一看似乎是难以理解的。Expanding on the example about optics, the nature of light is still an intriguing and unresolved topic which attracts scholarly debate. 让我们扩充一些光学的例子——光的本质仍然是悬而未决，引发学术辩论。Our current understanding is that light is both in a form of waves and particles, but this counterintuitive explanation itself seems a mystery that no one at this moment can elucidate. 目前我们的理解是，光既具备波的形式又具备粒子的形式，但这种反直觉的解释本身似乎就是一个目前无人可解的谜题。Thus the understanding of light's true nature requires additional study.. 因此对光的真正本质的理解还需要更多研究。Similar logic can be applied to the study of climate change. 同样的逻辑也可以应用于气候变化的研究。It was not until Milankovitch's insolation theory that scientists could quantitatively explain and predict glacial-interglacial cycles. 直到Milankovitch提出了日照理论，科学家才得以定量解释和预测冰期-间冰期循环。However, this knowledge raised new questions regarding mysterious events in Earth's climate history that have not yet been adequately explained. 然而，这种认知引出了新的关于地球气候历史中尚未得到充分解释的神秘事件的问题。The fact that new knowledge raises new questions does not suggest that we are unable to understand. 事实上，新的知识提出了新的问题并不意味着我们无法理解。On the contrary, those questions, coupled with our curiosity, drive our quest for knowledge. 相反，这些问题，伴随着我们的好奇，推动了我们队知识的求索。For example, there are many climate events that remain unaccountable by Milankovitch theory. 例如，Milankovitch的理论无法解释很多气候现象。In those cases, the Earth actually warmed despite very low energy flux from the Sun. 在这种情况下，尽管来自太阳的能量通量非常低，地球上实际上变得更暖了。Such mysteries actually led to a new subfield in climate science and to many new insights, which made the Earth's climate system more comprehensible to us . 这种谜团开辟了气候科学中一个新的子领域并催生了许多新见解，使地球的气候系统变得更加容易理解了。Mysteries are not permanent and are likely to be solved in the future. 谜团并不永远是谜团，在未来我们很有可能解决它们。As I have discussed, the world does not become more complex as a result of new knowledge but instead we gain a more comprehensive perception of is. New knowledge can indeed explain things we once found mysterious, but at the same time, it raise new, often puzzling questions. However, those questions are only mysterious until they are solved. Identification and Self-Definition - 38我是谁？我从哪来？我要去哪？It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statementand explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position,you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold ture andexplain how these considerations shape your position.Self-definition is gained through association with social groups, but is not achieved through self-identification. By arguing this, the author puts forth an interesting puzzle concerning the morphology of the root self. Admittedly, being gregarious and pursuing self-definition through contact with outside groups distinguishes us from other animals. We attend schools, we join parties, we engage in a variety of volunteer activities-it is through such social activities that we gain individual value and correctly locate ourselves. However, I argue that in many, even most, circumstances social groups play a disappointing role in helping us to define ourselves. In extreme circumstances, we may even be tossed about aimlessly in the turbulent ocean of society, deprived of appropriate self-definition. To begin with, the author turns a blind eye to the great number of cases in which we fail to define ourselves through interaction with other social groups. To exemplify this, we can consider a failed marriage, an unsuccessful job experience or a discouraging defeat in a contest. Not only do such interaction with others fail to contribute to satisfactory self-definition, but more importantly, they could possibly strip us of the confidence needed in life and hinder our ability to positively self-identify. Moreover, the author overlooks the vital role played by space in helping us to define ourselves. While it might be significant to maintain contact with others, it is equally important to reserve privacy for our spirit. Private space is especially vital in current society which is marked by the hustle-and-bustle pace of life. Shopping malls, bars, parks, these are all paradise for those in need of animated communication others; however, a secluded study room, a quiet house in the countryside, or even the lonely street corner in New York might benefit us considerably in terms of introspection. Through such introspection we are able to liberate ourselves from outside world's distracting forces and further attain some semblance of peace. This peace occupies an irreplaceable space in our city dwellers' hearts. Last but not least, as we go through different phase in life, we are bound to attempt different ways of identifying ourselves. The author, however, fails to categorize or elaborate on those phases of human life. It is ill-conceived to regard our life as one monotonous, tedious and variance-deprived chapter. On the contrary, life is fraught with changes and unexpected occurrences. Those episodes compel us to utilize different approaches to understand ourselves and acquire an appropriate sense of identity. In the nascent stage of our lives, we strive to understand the world through communication with others. It is this communication that helps us to gradually gain a more complete picture about the world and confidants, and we start families, sharing joy and sorrow with the ones we love. Jobs and family enable us to define ourselves as qualified employees, partners and parents. However, when we approach the end of our lives, we achieve a relatively exclusive status: we most frequently think about the past, both the miserable and happy times. We become introspective of what we have been through; such history belongs to us alone and it is through these experiences that we complete the final self-identification stage. If there was no such introspective life ritual, how pale would our lives be? To sum up, while it is reasonable to establish positive connections with others and define ourselves through such connections, in most cases I argue that we can go further and self-identify only by forming and possessing a strong and independent ego. “因果类”Regard Someone as a Hero - 44To Err is HumanAlexander PopeClaim: It is no longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero.Reason: The reputation of anyone who is subjected to media scrutiny will eventually be diminished.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claimand the reason on which claim is basedIn moder society where media coverage is ubiquitous, there is a claim that no living men or women can be regarded as heroes because their reputation, when subjected to media scrutiny, will eventually be diminished. In my opinion, it is undeniably true that media scrutiny is capable of deteriorating one's reputation; however, such abilities do not necessarily mean a hero's positive image will collapse. Even if heroes' imperfections are revealed, society may still regard living men or women as heroes. In the first place, no man is perfect and to err is human, says Alexander Pope. 首先，人无完人，Alexander.Pope说过，“人非圣贤，孰能无过”。Therefore, if every aspect of one's life is exposed to the public by the media, his or her reputation could certainly be compromised. 因此，当媒体把一个生活中的每一方面都暴露给公众，他/她的声誉肯定会受到损害。Some of his or her behaviors may not be accepted as the moral standard for a hero. 按照对英雄所设的道德标准，他/她的一些行为可能不会被接受。For example, a brave, heroic firefighter who is willing to risk his own life to save others' might be committing adultery, which, if revealed, would result in his reputation being defamed. 例如，一名英勇的消防员可能出轨，如果这种行为被揭露，他的声誉会受到损害。Also, the media may exaggerate a hero's negative side in order to gain more publicity. 此外，媒体可能会夸大英雄的消极面以吸引公众的注意力。In such extreme cases, media scrutiny could focus on a hero's derogatory remarks and bias public opinion towards him or her. 在这种极端的情况下，媒体监督可能会着重发表贬损英雄的评论并且让舆论对他/她心存偏见。That being said, the argument above assumes that the media will excessively probe into the heroes' personalities in details and/or focus on the negative. 话虽如此，上面的论证假设了媒体会过分详尽地探讨英雄的个性并聚焦于负面之上。This assumption, however, could bd wrong. 然后，这个假设可能是错误的。With regard to the first part, media may not be willing to invest time and resources discovering every negative aspect of a hero's life due to limited resources and perhaps weak public resonance it can provoke. 就前者而言，媒体可能不会愿意投入时间和资源来发掘英雄生活的每一处消极面，因为他们的资源是有限的，而这么做也许激不起什么公众反应。Furthermore, it would be unfair to assume that every media source is biased in this way. 此外，假设每家媒体都存在偏见也是不公平的。Thanks to the First Amendment, there are many independent media sources in the United States providing information from different angles. 多亏《第一修正案》，美国有许多独立的媒体来源，从不同角度为人们提供信息。Even if politically motivated, it would be almost impossible to require or force all media to dedicate its coverage to a hero's dark side. 即使存在政治动机，要求或迫使所有媒体都致力于报道英雄的黑暗面几乎是不可能的。Even if a hero's reputation is diminished to some extent by media scrutiny, it is still necessary for society to regard him or her as hero. 即使媒体监督一定程度上降低了英雄的声誉，社会仍然需要将他或她视为英雄。To understand this claim, we need to revisit the definition of hero. 要理解这个说法，我们需要重新审视英雄的定义。Heroes are those who possess essential qualities which are admired by people. 英雄是那些拥有人们崇敬的本质的人。In other words, it is those particular qualities, such as valor, self-sacrifice, and commitment to public interest, that make a man or woman a hero. 换句话说，正是这些品质，诸如勇气、自我牺牲和献身公益，让一个人成为英雄。Therefore, as long as those key qualities are not falsified by the media, heroes can exist despite negativity concerning their personalities. 因此，只要这些关键品质没有被媒体篡改，尽管他们的性格也有消极的一面，英雄仍然存在。Let's return to the aforementioned imaginary firefighter who has extramarital affair. 让我们回到前文所说假象的有婚外情的消防员。If he indeed saves other people's lives by sacrificing his own in a blaze, it;s not surprising at all that he will still be regarded as a hero. 如果他真的为了拯救别人的生命而牺牲了自我，那他被视为英雄是很自然的。It is the valor and commitment demonstrated through him paying the ultimate price that outweigh the stain on his character and earn him the title of hero. 他通过付出最高昂的代价展现了自己的英勇和承诺，正因此，这些品质改过了他性格上的污点，并且让他赢得了英雄的称号。To summarize, it is true that media scrutiny has the potential to diminish one's reputation. Because men are inherently imperfect, the media could deliberately focus on the negatives but hiss cannot be guaranteed. The media may not necessarily broadcast only negative aspects intended to destroy a hero's positive image. Even if the media did so, the public would still accept them because they possess key characteristics that define them as heroes. Terms in Office - 8江山代有才人出，各领风骚数百年。Claim: In any field-business, politics, education, government-those in power should step down after five years.Reason: The surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Charismatic leadership surely comprises an irreplaceable role in any enterprise's endeavor to success; nevertheless, sometimes a leader's charisma is relentlessly tarnished by stains which seem indelible. Sloth, misconduct and corruption are such stains that are at odds with a leader's usualy positive image. While those blots might exert a detrimental influence on the leader's image, I have to emphasize their infrequency. As a result, from my perspective, the author of the issue may be so pessimistic that he/she arbitrarily equates those sporadic blemishes with predestined failure and therefore fiercely advocates the revitalization of leadership every five years. In the field of politics, or more specifically in government, delinquency and crimes do occu. 在政界（更为确切的说，在政府），渎职或犯罪行为确有发生。Such delinquency and crimes most likely derive from persistent power maintenance and greatly hinder political achievement. 这些渎职和犯罪行为极有可能来源于长时间的权力维系，并且进一步阻碍了政治方面的任何可能的成就。Therefore, revitalization through new leadership is highly desired for success. 因此，领导力更替对于一个团队的成功来说至关重要。New leadership, once introduced, will bring about strict restrictions, if not a deadly crack down, on the old bureaucracy. 一旦引入，新的领导力即便无法打碎，也至少能够有效地制约陈腐的官僚作风。Those restriction will further witness a balance of power between the new and old politicians. 这样的限制还将见证新老政治家之间的权力平衡。As a result, a harmonious working ethic within the government is birthed and subsequent success can be expected. 因此，政府内部和谐的职业道德将因此被催生，随之而来的成功也指日可待。The regular presidential election in the United States, as well as in many other countries, exemplifies the significance of leadership revitalization within the political field. 包括美国在内的许多国家，定期举行的总统选举便很好地印证了在政治领域里的领导力更替的重要性。While many considerations contribute to such revitalization, the preclusion of corruption and other dishonest behaviors is no doubt one of the most important considerations. 尽管疾呼领导力更替的理由有很多，但“杜绝腐败以及其他不诚实行为”无疑是最为重要的动力。When we turn to the field of education, however, the situation is appallingly different. 然而，当我们转向教育领域时，情况则大不一样。When it comes to education, I disagree with this issue in terms of both its reason and claim. 换句话说，当谈到教育行业时，不论是从原因和结论来看，我都反对这种观点。I contend that the surest path to success in universities, high schools and other education institutions, is not through the revitalization of leadership but rather through educators'(including the presidents and teachers of those schools) insightful decisions about vital policies. 在大学，高中或其他教育机构，我认为获得成功的最为保险的路径，不是对领导力进行更替，而是教育者（包括该校校长和老师）对于核心政策的睿智判断。This insight, in most cases, springs from an accumulation of teaching experience. 这种洞察力，在大部分情况中，来源于教学经验的累积。A sufficiently long teaching history further requires that the educators maintain position stability, which frequently exceeds a period of five years. 一段足够长的教学经验需要教育者能够稳定地处于一个职位上，而这一般需要超过五年的时间。For supporting examples, we can only imagine a university undergoing a steady change of department directors, even presidents within a short period of years, or, perhaps even several months. 举例来说，如果一个大学经历了系主任的持续更替，或者不到一年、甚至只有几个月的持续校长更替。This leadership fluctuation would definitely lead to an interruption of educational policies with students being the victims. 这种领导人的替换势必导致教育政策的紊乱，并最终使学生成为受害者。However, if the leaders of the university are insightful and experienced enough to bring the university to a higher level, their tenure can be extended. 然而，如果大学领导人具备足够的洞察力以及经验，来进一步提升大学的水准，那么他们的任期则可以被延长。Finally, if we switch our attention to the field of business, we find that changes in leadership are much more flexible. 最后，如果我们将注意力投向商界，我们会发现“领导力更替”这个话题将变得更为灵活。All that a new leader should be equipped with is the potential or capability to bring maximum profits. 一位新领导最应该具备的是带来最大收益的潜力或能力。In the business world, unanticipated bargaining success could endow an unsung Joe with widespread reputation which even a much older businessman would covert. 在商界，一场不经意的成功交易可能使一个无名小卒在一夜之间享有极高的、让打拼多年的商场老手也垂涎不已的名声。However, it is of equal possibility that an eminently respected entrepreneur could lose his/her crown overnight for an unexpected failure in a regular negotiation. 然而，同样可能的是，因为一场普通交易的惨败，一位驰骋商界多年的老手在一夕之间失掉他/她的“王冠”。From this perspective, neither the reason nor the claim of this issue stands tenable in the business filed. 因此，从商业角度来看，作者的说法，无论是从理由还是结论都无法站稳脚跟。Leadership hings on profits-this allegation may sound harsh, but few would dispute its validity. “领导力取决于利润”，这句话虽然直白，但极少有人质疑。While every enterprise should strive for success, the means via which the enterprise should utilize is conditional on more thorough considerations. As a result, whether a leader should step down after five years requires further deliberations. Convincing Brings Value - 75雄辩启迪了思想，沉默激发了情感Claim: The best test of an argument is its ability to convince someone with an opposing viewpoint.Reason: Only by being forced to defend an idea against the doubts and contrasting views of othersdoes one really discover the value of that idea.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.To bestow an argument, idea, contention or assertion with value, we must attempt to persuade those who hold contrasting views. 为了赋予一个论点、观点、主张或声称以价值，我们必须试图去说服那些持相反观点的人。Once we manage to convince our opponents, our argument seemingly gains fresh significance. 一旦我们成功地说服对手，我们的论点似乎就获得了更多的重要性。This inclination to persuade others with our ideas presumably derives from the action embodied in the verb argue: to persuade people with relevant reasons that we are correct. 这种试图用我们的观点去说服对方的倾向，可能来自于动词“辩论”所蕴含的动作：用相关的理由去让对方相信“我方正确”。While this might be one way to prove our argument's validity and value, we do not always need to resort to this method. 虽然这可能是一条提升我们论证有效性和价值的路径，但我们不一定非要采用这样的方式。Additionally, sometimes attempts to persuade might even prove futile. 此外，“尽可能说服对方的做法”有时被证明是一种无效的尝试。To begin with, I must express my appreciation for the reason part of this issue. 首先，我对这道题目的reason部分表示赞同。It is exactly at the moment when we are forced to defend an idea against doubts and contrasting views that we begin to form a comprehensive understanding of the idea's value. 每当我们被迫去辩护一个受到质疑或者存在对立看法的观点时，其实已经就这个观点的价值形成更为全面的认知。It is also at such a moment that we should grasp the opportunity to show our rivals the advantages of our argument and earn their approval. 也就是这个时候，我们会抓住机会向我们的对手展示己方论点的优势，并尝试获得他们的认同。This perspective is emphasized by how a debate takes place. 这种思维在辩论中体现得最为明显。In a debate, speakers strive to elucidate the advantages or the disadvantages of an issue iin order to convince their opponents, as well as the audience of their point of view. 在一场辩论中，为了说服对手以及他们的支持者，发言者就一个问题努力阐明其优势与劣势。It is also during this phase that the audience comes to establish a holistic understanding of the topic and its value. 也正是在这个阶段，观众对这个话题和它的价值建立起更为完善的认知。In addition, even though the debaters may not be utterly convinced by their opponents, they ultimately benefit from questioning their opponents and defending their own view, and further build up an unprecedented understanding of their argument's value. 另外，尽管辩论者并未完全被他们的对手说服，但他们也终将通过质问对手、辩护己方立场而获益，从而进一步深化他们对己方论点的价值的认知。However, tenable as the assertion may hold in most circumstance that an idea receives value by overshadowing its opponents, I contend that the value of an argument can be also realized in other ways. 然而，通过征服对手来使观点获得价值，尽管这种说法在大多数情况中都具有说服力，但我依然认为一个论点的增值还可以通过其他方式获得。Consequently, this raises doubt about the issue's reason. 这也就质疑了这道题目的reason部分。Since we do not argue exclusively to disprove our rivals, but also to clarify our own principles, or support allegations, we do not always have to start a battle in which one argument is bound to knock down another. 由于我们争论的目的并不只是为了推翻对手，同时还有阐释我方的原则，或者支持我方的论点等目的，所以我们就没有必要总是掀起一场“只有一方能够幸存”的论战。Academic papers serve as a simple but persuasive example. 比如说，学术论文是一个简单且富有说服力的例子。It is not difficult to find our that not all the articles we read, write or cite attempt to disprove others, but in more circumstances concentrate on either clarification of the methodologies the paper itself utilizes, or on supplementary explanation to similar studies. 不难发现，并不是所有我们看到的、写的、引用的文章都是以推翻其他文章为目的；相反，在更多的情况下，这些文章专注于对论文本身采用的方法论的阐释，或者对相似研究进行的补充说明。One semester I read a series of articles written by archaeologists, historians and anthropologists regarding ancient Chinese rituals. 记得有一个学期，我阅读了一系列有考古学家、历史学家和人类学家写作的有关古代中国仪式的文章。Despite their contrasting arguments, these scholars did not focus on discrediting each other's work. 尽管这些文章的观点不同，但文章的作者并未执着于推翻彼此的观点。On the contrary, they simply offer different interpretations of the same issue. 相反，他们只是就相同的问题提出不同的解释。The value of these papers is therefore achieved through their interpretations rather than through contention between the authors. 因此，这些论文的价值来源于其各自的阐释而非对彼此观点的推翻。What is more, the writer's over-optimistic attitude is betrayed in the claim of the issue, which is supported by an unsubstantiated assumption: everyone can be convinced by an opposing viewpoint. 另外，这个题目的claim部分还暴露了作者过度乐观的态度，因为claim部分被一个为被证实的假设所支持：每个人都能被相反的观点说服。This assumption further theorizes that an absolute truth exists, or to put it in another way: everything can be explained in only one way. 这个假设还进一步假定：绝对真理存在于世，或者说，所有事物都只能有唯一解释。Clearly, this is not true. 很明显，这并不正确。THe example previously discussed about three different interpretations of one issue support my opinion. 前文讨论过的对同一话题的三种不同解释的例子能够支持这一观点。Since academic research is based on different methodologies, scholars can never be truly convinced by each other; otherwise they would have used identical systems but not diverse ones. 由于学术研究基于不同的方法论，所以学者之间并不能完全说服彼此：除非他们采用相同的系统。In addition, in some circumstances, the superficial debate between two arguments actually reveals an irreconcilable conflict, which concerns more fundamental factors, such as benefits. 另外，在一些情况下，两方之间的一次肤浅的争论也可能揭示出无法调和的冲突，而这种冲突往往与更为基本的元素相关，比如利益。For exemplifications, we can look at strife between political parties all over the world. 举例来说，我们可以关注世界各地的政党间的冲突。Due to the irreconcilable contention about respective interests, their quarrels never cease, and probably no one can foretell the day when they wil actually convince each other. 因为基于各自利益的不可调和的争论，题目之间的争吵永不停息，并且也无人能够预测到他们能够说服彼此的那一天。To sum up, while I partly agree with the issue;s reason, I reserve ny approval of both the claim and its assumption. That is to say, the value of an argument may be realized through debate with someone holding a contrasting viewpoint, yet we cannot rely on that to always be true. “两种看法类”People’s Will or Own Decisions - 86of the people, by the people and for the people.Abraham LincolnSome people believe that government officials must carry out the wil of the people they serve.Others believe that officials should base their decisions on their own judgment.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position andexplain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position,you should address both of the views presented.Which criterion should be given more weight when assessing government officials, their determination to carry out the will of people they serve or their ability to stand by their own decisions? While some designate government officials as public servants, others appreciate officials' resolution to make their own judgment, with public's will relegated to a secondary concern. While both of these views have merit, I argue that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. On the one hand, I concede that government officials are created by the demands from the people they serve and therefore officials should behave in accordance with the will of those people. 一方面，我认为政府官员（这个角色）是由人民的需求所创造的，因此官员的决策一个符合人民的意愿。First, government's central role in regulating its nation's affairs obliges officials to work for their citizen's benefit. 首先，由于政府在国家事务中扮演核心角色，所以政府官员必须为人民谋福利。In addition, government officials are simultaneously citizens themselves, which gives them unique insight and understanding of citizen request. 另外，政府官员同时也是人，这赋予了题目独特的视角以及对人民需求的了解。While Abraham Lincoln has perished in history long ago, we could still see every generation of government officials bestirring themselves indefatigably at their positions, echoing Lincoln's prestigious motto of the people, by the people and for the people. 尽管亚伯拉罕·林肯是因为相当久远的历史人物，但至今我们仍能看到每一任政府官员都在不厌其烦地引用他的至理名言以激励自己：“民治、民有、民享”。Those officials prioritize what the public desire not only because they derive their power from the public, but also because they are citizens themselves and accordingly benefit from their own achievements. 这些政府官员之所以重视人民的需求，不仅是因为他们的权力来源于大众，还在于他们自身也是人民，并将最终受益于自己的政绩。In great contrast, people who believe that officials should base their decisions on their own judgment assign little importance to the will of the people. 相反，有些人认为官员应该根据自己的判断所做决定，所以不必太在意人民的需求。From this perspective, officials' individual preference takes absolute precedence. 这种观点认为，官员个人的偏好理应享有优先权。While this claim might initially sound somewhat implausible and might even remind us of obdurate bureaucracy or headstrong leaders, it can in some circumstances serve the greater good. 尽管这种说法乍听之下显得有些不可思议，甚至会让人想起那些刚愎自用的官僚机构或自大顽固的领导人，但在某些情况下，它的确可以带来更广泛的益处。Officials confronted by dilemmas which force them to choose between the public's wishes and their own judgment may choose to sacrifice the former for the latter. 到底听从公众的意愿还是个人的判断？面临这样的困局，一些官员们会选择牺牲前者而选择后者。We cannot call those officials tyrannical, however, since their actions are based on the long-term interests which will benefit the majority. 然而，我们不能将这些官员视作蛮横暴虐，因为他们的所为是从长远利益出发的，并将最终造福大多数人。Roosevelt's New Deal sufficiently exemplifies my argument. 其中，罗斯福新政便能充分印证我的论点。Had Roosevelt not subordinated capitalist interest and conjured up a marriage between market economy and government regulation, current Americans might still be suffering from the effects of the Great Depression. 如果罗斯福当时没有压制资本家的利益，并创造性地将“市场经济与政府干预”结合起来，当今美国可能仍在大萧条的泥潭中苦苦挣扎。Even though Roosevelt implemented a series of policies in spite of business opposition, we do not judge him to have acted irresponsibly or autocratically. 尽管罗斯福不顾商业街的反对，实施了这一系列政策，我们也很难将他的决策视作不负责任或独裁。On the contrary, we applaud his policies because they stemmed from comprehensive concerns of what would benefit Americans overall. 相反，我们称赞他的政策，因为它脱胎于对美国未来整体利益的综合考量。In this way, Roosevelt well embodies an efficient leader who struck a harmonious balance between the public's wishes and hist wo decision. 这样看来，通过平衡公众意愿与个人决策之间的关系，罗斯福成功地展现了一位高效领导人所具备的素质。The above-stated examination of the two vies discloses my appreciation for both of them. Nevertheless this is not to say that I suggest appraising these two perspectives in isolation. Rather, I would like to view the process of policy-making of government officials as a continuum that includes public voices and officials' individual decisions. An insightful official should and is able to make decisions on the basis of the will of the people he serves; meanwhile citizens should attempt to understand that those policies have undergone thorough consideration regarding the potential benefits and consequences. The ideal world I depict is one in which leaders and public enjoy a harmonious relationship and both benefit from policy decisions. Goal of Politics - 151求同存异Some people claim that the goal of politics should be the pursuit of an ideal. Others argue that the goalshould be finding common ground and reaching consensus.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position andexplain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position,you should address both of the views presented.What is the ultimate purpose or goal of politics supposed to be? There are two seemingly contradictory view on this question. One side argues that the ultimate goal of politics should be pursuit ideals, while the other regards finding common ground and reaching consensus as the goal. I tend to give my support to the former view based on the nature of politics, while I object to the latter since it may result in many negative consequences. Firstly, the ultimate goal of politics in my opinion should be constructing a world in which people can enjoy their lives and can fulfill their dreams by utilizing their talents and potentials to the maximum. 首先，我认为政治的最终目标应该是建设一个人们可以最大限度地发挥他们的才能和潜力，从而享受生活、实现梦想的世界。In this light, this world is certainly idealistic. 就此而论，这个世界当然是理想主义的。To understand why such an ideal world should be the goal of politics, one must first understand what politics stands for and where it originates. 要理解为什么这样的一个理想的世界是政治的目标，人们首先要理解政治时代的意义和它的起源。Politics rose from a contract between governors and citizens, where the people authorized the governors' power and governors, in turn, provided essential services to the people. 政治起源于统治者和公民之间的契约，人民授予统治者权利，而统治者反过来为人民提供必要的服务。To promote the well being of the people was the ultimate intended goal of this contract, and it is through this contract that politics came into existence. 促进人民的福祉是这项契约的终极预定目标，正是通过这项契约才诞生了政治。Politics has inherited this contract's goal and should therefore strive to serve the people by constructing an ideal world. 政治继承了这项契约的目标，因此应该通过建设一个理想的世界为人民服务。On the contrary, it is dangerous to abide by the view that the goal of politics should be finding common ground and reaching consensus. 相反，坚持政治目标应该找到共同点和达成共识的观点是危险的。When there is no ideal principle to guide our behavior, our moral ground becomes shaky,. 当没有理想的原则指导我们的行为是，我们的道德之地就变得摇摇欲坠了。For example, in this pragmatic ideology, we may sacrifice innocent people for the sake of so-called consensus. 例如，在这种务实为上的意识形态中，我们可能会为了所谓的共识而牺牲无辜的民众。Throughout human history, there are mny incidents in which the countries collude in reaching peace and consensus, but at the cost of other small nations and in violation of the moral principles. 人类历史上充满了大国之间为了实现和平和达成共识而密谋牺牲小国利益的故事，这显然是有违于道德准则的。From a humanitarian perspective the result is undeniably tragic. 从人道主义的角度来看这无疑是一个悲剧。That being said, finding common ground and reaching consensus are still pivotal in politics. 话虽如此，找到共同点和达成共识在政治中仍然是至关重要的。Without these, pursuing ideals could have disastrous political consequences. 没有这些，追求理想可能会产生灾难性的政治后果。Similar examples can be readily found in the sporadic turbulence of the current society. 现代社会中偶尔会发生的动乱也是很好的例子。These examples demonstrate how dangerous it can be when we commit ourselves to an ideal zealously without proper controls. 这些例子表明，当我们没有适度控制的情况下，一头热地献身于理想是多么危险。Modern democracy based on negotiation and finding common ground, on the other hand, shows us the power of compromise and consensus. 另一方面，基于谈判和寻求共同点的现代政治制度向我们展示妥协和共识的力量。To conclude, I believe that the goal of politics should be pursuing ideals rather than finding common ground and reaching consensus. However, even though common ground and consensus should not be the goal of politics, it does not mean that they are of no significance. On the contrary, common ground and compromise are essential in controlling zealousness and help us realize our ideals. Save Plant and Animal Species - 67拯救濒危生命，或许也是在拯救人类自己。Some people believe that society should try to save every plant and animal species,despite the expense to humans in effort, time, and financial well-being. Others believethat society need not make extraordinary efforts, especially at a great cost in money and jobs to save endangered species.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position andexplain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position,you should address both of the views presented.With the growing influence of environmentalism, many consider the conservation of endangered species a moral obligation that humankind must acknowledge and fulfill. Some even argue that society must strive to save every plant and animal species at any const, while there is a conflicting view. Society should not, such a view insists, expend too many resources, which could otherwise be used to create wealth and jobs, trying to save endangered species. My stace is slightly more aligned with the former, though my argument contains the specific prerequisite that society must save endangered species only if a species' extinction would lead to economic loss greater than the cost of saving that species. Before elaborating on my reasoning, it is necessary to address a number of potential objections based on the nature of my view. 在阐述我的论证前，有必要先基于我的观点的本质来讨论一些潜在的反对看法。I expect initial emotional responses to likely be negative from the public. 我预计最初的负面反应可能来自于公众。Environmentalists, for exam[le, would strongly condemn my position and argue that driving a species to extinction is a crime against nature, since every species is equal and humans are not entitled to slaughter other species. 比如，环保主义者就会强烈谴责我的观点，他们认为让某一物种灭绝是对自然的犯罪，因为所有的物种都是平等的，而人类没有权利屠杀其他物种。However, extinction is not new to nature. 然后，对大自然来说，灭绝并不是什么新鲜事。It has happened throughout Earth's long geologic history, long before modern humans occupied every continent except Antarctica. 灭绝贯穿于地球漫长的地质历史中，早在现代人类占领除了南极洲以外的每个大陆之前就有。Geological discoveries inform us of five major extinction events in the last 400 million years; in this short geological period, more than three quarters of life on Earth aws wiped out. 地质发现告诉我们在过去的四亿年中发生了五次重要的生物群灭绝；在这短暂的地质时代，地球上四分之三以上的生物都灭绝了。Consequently, human beings are not morally bound to preserve the status quo of Earth's current biological diversity. 因此，人类在道德上并不一定要保护地球生物多样性的现状。We should not save every species without considering their socioeconomic consequences. 我们不应该不考虑社会经济后果去保护每一个物种。This does not necessarily mean we should never take action to preserve endangered species. 但这并不意味着我们不应该采取行动保护濒危物种。If the resulting loss from a species' extinction exceeds the cost of saving it, we should definitely protect it. 如果一个物种灭绝造成的损失大于保护它的成本，我们当然应该保护它。Consider the following three examples. 让我们来思考下列三个例子。We appreciate pandas som uch that the loss these species would be regarded as a heavy emotional loss. 我们如此喜欢大熊猫，每只大熊猫的死亡都让我们十分痛苦。We support the protection of raptors, such as eagles and falcons, because their extinction would allow rodents to proliferate and result in significant crop losses. 我们支持保护猛禽，例如鹰和猎鹰，是因为它们的灭绝将使得啮齿动物变多、危害农作物。And some endangered species have genetic and research value, which could lead to cures for diseases like cancer. 一些濒危物种具有遗传学或者其他的研究价值，也许能让我们治愈疾病——比如癌症。The definition of loss in these cases encompasses broader social consequences rather than being solely financial. 这些案例中的“损失”的定义囊括了更广泛的社会结果，而不是仅仅指经济损失。Another reason we should save a species is that it provides a relatively objective and measurable benchmark to assess our policy. 我们应该保护物种的另一个原因是，它提供了相对客观和可量化的基准来评估我们的政策。What would happen if we spared no expense to save every endangered species? What if the resources expended saving them could be used to save refugees of wars and famine? 如果我们不惜代价地拯救每一个濒危物种，会发生什么事？如果节省这些花掉的资源可以用来拯救战争和饥荒中的难民呢？It may be acceptable to deem humans and other species as equal but when they are in conflict should other species take priority over human life? 也许我们会接受万物平等的观点，但当人同其他生物互相冲突时，其他物种的生命优于人命吗？Assuming responsibility for the protection of all species is dangerous and violates basic human principles, which are the foundation of modern civilization. 认为保护所有物种是人类的责任是危险的，违反了作为现代文明基础的基本的人道原则。Therefore, we must utilize reasonable methods when deciding whether or not to save a species from extinction. 因此，我们必须运用合理的方法来决定是否应该拯救一个濒危物种。The real challenges is how to evaluate the loss of a species. 真正的挑战在于如何评估物种的损失。This is not a question that can be sufficiently addressed in this short response, but simple classification into four categories can elucidate hwo the value of a species is ascertained. 这篇短文中无法充分讨论这个问题，但简单的四分类法可以帮助阐明如何确定一个物种的价值。The first is direct economic value associated with domesticated species. 第一类是与驯养物种相关的直接经济价值。The second is economic value associated with the ecological function of a species, exemplified by raptors which prey on rodents. 第二类是同一物种的生态功能相关的经济价值，例如捕食啮齿动物的猛禽。The third is a species' research value. 第三类是物种的研究价值。And the final category is cultural, religious, and aesthetic value, though this is admittedly more difficult to determine. 最后一类是文化、宗教、审美价值，虽然这个类别确实更加难以确定。To summarize, I do not advocate allowing all endangered species to go extinct but believe it is unwise to strive to rescue every endangered species out of vague moral obligations. We should take action only when the loss of an entire species outweighs the costs associated with saving it. “敌方看法类”Maintain the highest Ethical and Moral standers - 104修身治国平天下To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim.In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examplesthat could be used to challenge your positionA leader is elected to lead the government and serve the people. The personalities of leaders have always been the center of political discussions. Some people claim that an official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards in order to be an effective leader. From my point of view, people with high moral standards will be more inclined to be effective leaders but these high standards do not necessarily achieve effectiveness. In some cases, remaining loyal to high moral principles without any chance of compromise will weaken a leaders' effectiveness. Before going any further, it is necessary to clarity the definition of effective. 在进一步展开论述之前，我们有必要澄清“有效力”的定义。Since the mission of a political leader, in my view, is to unite the people, distribute limited resources, and make important decisions to ensure social prosperity. 在我看来，由于政治领袖的使命是团结人名，分配有效资源和做出重要决策以确保社会繁荣。Simply put, an effective leader must promote the welfare of the people he or she serves. 简单来说，有效力的领导必须提升他/她所服务的人们的福祉。WIth this definition, we can now discuss how moral standards impact a leader's effectiveness. 在这一定义下，现在我们可以讨论道德标准如何影响领导者的效力了。Maintaining high ethical and moral standards can definitely promote a leader's effectiveness because his or her personality will attract support and cooperation from the public. 维持高道德标准当然可以提升一位领导者的效力，因为他/她的性格将会吸引公众的支持和合作。In other words, his or her political views are more likely to be accepted by the people, making political goals more likely to achieve. 换句话说，他/她的政治观点更有可能被人接受，更有可能实现政治目的。For example, in Chinese history an emperor with high moral standards was usually admired and loved by his people. 例如，在中国历史中，一位高道德标准的皇帝常常受到子民的欣赏和爱戴。People were more willing to execute the emperor's orders, facilitating the accomplishment of his political goals. 人们更愿意执行皇帝的命令，加快完成他的政治目标。That is why strong, prosperous dynasties, such as these of the Han, Tang and Song, were founded by emperors with high moral principles. 这就是为什么强大而繁荣的王朝，如汉、唐、宋，都是由具有高道德原则的皇帝建立的。However, effectiveness does not necessarily originate in the more standards. 然而，效力并不一定来源于道德标准。The possession of high moral standards cannot guarantee a leader will be effective nor can a leader's effectiveness be denied if he or she does not possess superior moral qualities. 拥有高道德标准并不能保证领导人一定有效力；若一位领导人并不具有高道德素质，我们也不能否认他/她的效力。For instance, imagine a country plagued by terrorism. 例如，假想一个饱受恐怖主义困扰的国家。One of the primary goals of the country's leaders in this scenario is to defend the people they serve. 这个国家领导人的主要目标之一就是保卫人民。If they could lead the nation to win the war on terror, despite some immoral means taken to achieve the goal, they must be considered effective. 如果他们能够带领国家赢得反恐困扰的国家战争的胜利，那么即便在这个过程中他们采用了不道德的手段，他们也应该被认为是卓有成效的领导人。Some may argue that without high moral qualities leaders will be despised or even overthrown. 有些人可能认为没有高道德素质的领导人会被鄙视乃至推翻。How can a leader be effective when he or she is not is power? Leaders may lose power if they are morally despicable but they are not required to have the highest moral standards. 如果一个领导者没能上台，他/她还如何发挥效力呢？道德卑下的领导者可能会失去权利，但他们并不需要最高的道德标准。People can be quite tolerant when it comes to their leader's morality. 在领导者道德问题上，人们可以相当宽容。As long as a leader's moral qualities do not jeopardize the people's interests, minor defects can be ignored. 若领导者的道德素养不会损害人民的利益，人们会忽视他们的小缺陷。After all, given the definition of effectiveness above, an immoral leader may accomplish his or her mission if he or she is able to identify critical social goals and has the skills to coordinate governmental operations. 毕竟，鉴于上述对效力的定义，如果一个不道德的领导者能确定关键的社会目标并具备协调政府运作的能力，他/她也能完成自己的使命。These are the true sources of effectiveness. 这些才是效力的真正来源。In additions, in some cases adhering to the highest moral standards actually backfires, because some high moral principles, such as honesty and integrity, require actions that place national interest in jeopardy. 此外，在某些情况下，坚持最高的道德标准会适得其反，因为有些高尚的道德原则，如诚实和正直，要求采取使国家利益受损的行为。If, for example, a nations's leader is asked to reveal confidential and sensitive information concerning national defense, he or she ought to, from a purely moral perspective, be candid and not withhold any information. 例如，如果一个国家的领导人被要求披露有关国家的机密和敏感信息，从纯粹的道德角而言，他/她应该坦诚相待、不隐瞒任何信息。However, we could easily recognize the danger of revealing such information to the public, which could be abused by terrorists. 然而，我们很容易认识到向公众披露这些信息的危险性，因为这些信息可能会被恐怖分子所滥用。Some may argue this example is too absolute and rare and thus cannot serve as compelling evidence. 或许有些人会说这个例子太极端罕见了，因此不能作为令人信服的例子。This scenario, however, reflects the inherent conflict between moral ideology and reality, in which compromises are often required. 然而，这种情况反映了道德和现实之间的内在冲突，这种冲突往往要求妥协。Such conflict is ubiquitous in the real world. 这样的冲突在现实世界是普遍存在的。To summarize, it is evident that high moral qualities do not equate to effective leadership. In some cases a leader's loyalty without exception to high moral principles can create serious problems and even harm social interests. That being said, possessing high moral standards can help leaders achieve their political mission, because such qualities will help them earn people's trust and support and facilitate governmental efficiency. The Major and Other Filed - 13学校的目标应当是培养有独立行动和独立思考的个人，不过他们要把为社会服务看作是自己人生的最高目标。爱因斯坦Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student’s filed of study.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim.In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/orexamples that could be used to challenge your position.After undergoing a marathon journey from primary to high school and then to university, students are confronted by another dilemma: how to strike a balance between their majors and courses in other fields. A similar quandary must have perplexed educators for decades as they grappled with designing university courses. While at first glance it may seem appealing to require students to take various courses outside of their fields of study. I remain doubtful of such a proposal. If we hastily carry out the advice, it would probably jeopardize education's purpose of facilitating students' well-roundedness. Advocates of this claim wil reject my position. 这条建议的拥护者可能会反对我的观点。They argue that knowledge gained from other fields contributes to innovative approaches to understanding the majors. 他们也许认为，从其他专业获得的知识能够为学生深入理解其专业贡献新的途径。The blending of different methodologies from various fields exemplifies this argument. 各领域的方法论的综合似乎能够佐证这一观点。For supporting examples, we can no further turn to the cooperation of linguistics and literature and the combination of math and economics. 其中，最为恰当的例子莫过于语言学与文学的穿插，教学与经济学的交织。What bind these pairs are similar methodologies. 相似的方法论将这些组合成功勾连起来。By transferring a methodology from one field to another, students are able to understand the essence of both fields and this leads to the emergence of creative ideas and more profound understanding. 通过将一个领域中的方法论转移到另一个领域，学生们能够同时理解这两个领域的精髓，并在此基础上教育部催生各类新颖的观点以及更为深刻的理解。However, not all fields relate as readily as the aforementioned pairs, so we cannot expect to apply principles from any field to another. 然而，并非所有领域都如前面列举的组合那般紧密相连，我们不能期望任何领域之间的原理都能相互适用。Therefore, only when the courses share similar methodological principles can the author's recommendation come into effect. 因此，只有在方法论原理近似的科目之间，作者的建议才能产生实际意义。Opposition to my argument also comes from current students' limited range of knowledge and narrow horizons. 反对我的观点还可能提到：当今学生的有限知识与狭窄视角。From this point of view, university students should be equipped with holistic capabilities in diverse fields so that they can better accustom themselves to diverse work in the future. 从这个角度来看，大学生确实应该具备多种领域的综合能力，以便于题目为了能够更好地适应各种工作。In modern society we are not surprised to encounter a professional lawyer who excels at public speaking; not will it shock us when a mathematician assumes the role of a philosopher. 在现代社会，如果遇到一名职业律师精通公开演讲，我们不会感到惊讶；同样，如果看到数学家能够像哲学家一样思考，我们也不会诧异。An abundance of these generalists demonstrates the very advantage of a mastery of comprehensive skills and expertise. 大量的通才向我们反复证明掌握多门技巧和专长的益处。Nevertheless, I argue that generalists choose to be excellent, but are not required to be. 然而，我认为通才的产生是自行选择的结果，而非强制要求使然。It is their insatiable desire for knowledge that drives them to conquer new fields one after another, and it is their proficiency in the previous fields that enables them to excel in the new ones. 正式由于只是本身永不满足的欲望，使其能够不断征服新的领域；也正是因为对前一领域知识的精通，帮助其在后续领域中占据优势。Students nowadays are exceedingly short of time and universities should foster, in most circumstances, specialists rather than generalists. 当今学生的时间已然十分有限，在大部分情况下，大学应该培养专才而非通才。Consequently, while we welcome generalists, it might be more reasonable if we step back from the decision requiring students to choose courses in various disciplines, and adopt an alternative policy: encourage them to take extra courses and do whatever we can to facilitate this process. 因此，尽管欢迎通才，但更为合理的做法是：我们放弃要求学生选修大量非专业课程的决定，转而采取另一条政策：鼓励学生选修非专业课程，并尽一切可能帮助他们加速成为通才。Although, I maintain that encouraging course selection may function better than a mandatory requirement, some people may dispute my position. 尽管我认为鼓励而非强制学生选课会达到更好的效果，但有人可能会站出来反对我的观点。They claim that the latter overshadows the former in terms of efficiency, since sluggishness is human nature and it is only through compulsory course requirements that students will really make progress in their major fields. 从效率来看，他们认为后者明显强于前者，因为懒惰是人类的天性，所以只有通过强制选课，学生们才能在其本专业领域取得进步。The beginning of every course, they argue, inevitably stumbles on questioning and even emphatic repudiation; however, such questioning and repudiation will be followed by subsequent acceptance and students will quickly absorb new knowledge. 他们可能相信，一开始这些课程会不可避免地遭受学生们的质疑甚至怨怼；但是，这样的质疑或斥责将逐渐被接纳所取代，随后学生将开始迅速吸收新的知识。Consistent might this claim appear with the reality, I tend to say that students do not learn for the sake of learning, and instead they learn in order to pass tests. 然而在我看来，与这条建议更为相符的现实是：学生并不会为了学习而学习，相反，会为了通过考试而学习。Whatever from is used to test students, be it an exam, a paper submission of group work, students always tend to focus on the test itself, but not on the accumulation of knowledge. 不论以任何形式出现的考试：测验、个人作业或者小组作业，学生们总会注重测试本身，而非任何知识上的积累。Without adjusting students' attitude towards learning the introduction of various new courses will remain well-intentioned but will inevitably result in a meaningless struggle against the exam-oriented education system. 如果不对学生们的学习态度进行调整，而贸然引入各类非专业课程，那么此举只能停留在好心办坏事的层面，并最终使学生陷以考试为导向的教育系统中，做者毫无意义的挣扎。Taking extra courses outside one's original field goes far beyond the decision of whether or not to take them, but raises more fundamental and far-reaching issues. We may tentatively implement the issue's recommendation, but a complete change in the design of university courses require more careful consideration. “建议类”Interest or Job Orientation - 39路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them rather than the courses that seem most likely to lead to jobs.Writer a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with then recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take.In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adoptingthe recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Should college students be encouraged to take classes that truly interest them or select courses that seem most likely to increase their competitiveness in the job market? From my point of view, pursuing interests should be prioritized over practical concerns but students with financial difficulties may find it more desirable to take courses that will lead to decent jobs. It is also worth pointing our that students can take courses based on Interest while also taking classes specifically improve their employment prospects. Interest is the most powerful motivator in students' academic endeavors so pursing subjects which interest them may lead to greater academic achievements. 兴趣是学生学术活动中最有利的激励因素，因此让学生追求他们最有兴趣的学科能带来更大的学术成就。When students face challenges in their classes, they must have a firm belief to carry on or they might simply quit. 当学术在课堂上面临挑战是，我们必须怀有坚定的信念才能继续下去，不然他们可能就会放弃。Although the prospect of a well-paid job may seem like a strong motive, it is actually far less effective than personal interest. 虽然高薪工作的前景似乎是一个强烈的动机，但它事实上远不如个人兴趣有效。This is because when students strive for decent careers, it takes a long time for their efforts to pay off 这是因为当学生为体面的工作而努力时，体面的努力需要很长时间才能获得回报。Consequently, their motivation could fail whereas personal interest could sustain them. 因此，他们的积极性可能受挫，然而个人兴趣缺可以让他们继续。Therefore, in order to make greater intellectual achievements, students should be encouraged to enroll in classes that interest them. 因此为了取得更大的智力成就，我们应当鼓励学生参加他们感兴趣的课程。Behind the claim that students should take courses likely to result in jobs is the assumption that it is possible to determine whether or not a specific class is capable of doing so. 主张学生参加有助于就业的课程的背后是这样一个假设：我们可以确定某门课程有这个作用。This assumption may not always hold true because the job market changes quickly and can be hard to make accurate prediction. 这一假设并不一定总是正确的，因为就业市场变化很快，很难做出正确的预测。For example, in the field of computer sciences, there are incessant changes in prevalent programming language. 例如，在计算机科学领域，流行的编程语言正在不断变化。A few years ago, C was the industrial standard so courses in that language would have been helpful when searching for a job. 几年前，C语言是工业标准，因此C语言课程对于找工作是有帮助的。It did not take long, however, for Java and Python to become dominant and knowledge in C is no longer valuable,. 但好景不长，Java和Python变成了主流语言，C语言知识不再有价值。In short, such useful courses can become obsolete by the time students graduate because of the short timescale of changes in the job market. 简而言之，因为就业市场时常发生变化，这些“有用”的课程在学生毕业的时候可能会过时。This is clearly not a desirable out come for students. 这对学生而言显然不是一个理想的结果。However students experiencing financial difficulties may depend on a promising career to improve their (or their family's) economic situation. 然而，财务困难的学生困难需要一份有前途的工作来改善他们（或他们的家庭）的经济情况。They may prefer to place more emphasis on courses that can earn them a better job than what they are interested. 他们可能更喜欢把重点放在那些能为他们赢得更好工作的课程，而不是他们感兴趣的课程上。In this particular scenario, the argument that a future career is not strong motivation does not hold true because the desire to change one's fate can be extremely powerful. 在这种情况下，“未来职业并不是强烈的动机”的论点就不成立了，因为一个人想要改变自己命运的愿望可能非常强烈。Finally, it is also necessary to address the underlying assumption in this debate that courses which interest students are different from those conducive to finding jobs. 最后，还有必要解决争论中的潜在假设：让学生感兴趣的课程和有助于他们找到工作的课程是不同。This is problematic and does not always hold true. 这个假设可能是有问题的，并不总是成立。Even for those classes that seem to have few practical connections to the real world, they can still teach students vital skills needed to secure decent jobs and succeed in their careers. 即使是那些看起来和现实世界没有多少联系的课程，他们仍然可能教给学生得到体面工作和在职业生涯中成功的重要技能。For example, advanced theoretical physics involving abstruse ideas and mathematics may seem useless in the job market at first glance, but these courses teach students how to think critically, simplify complex systems in a model and acquire solid mathematical skills essential in the financial world. 例如，乍一看涉及深奥思想和数学知识这些高级理论的物理学在就业市场中毫无作用，但这些课程教导学生如何批判性思考，在模型中简化复杂问题，并让他们获得在金融界十分必要的坚实的数学技能。Firms on Wall Street are actively seeking job candidates with solid background in math, physics and computer science, which is a compelling piece evidence that courses of interest can also lead to jobs. 华尔街的公司正在寻找那些具备数学、物理和计算机科学背景的求职者，这是一个很有力的证据证明凭兴趣选择的课程也能赢得好工作。In conclusion, it is beneficial for students to pursue subjects that interest them but students should take their financial situation into consideration when selecting courses. Job availability and students' interest do not constitute an irreconcilable dichotomy; classes can be both interesting and beneficial to the job market. Studying in a Foreign Country - 100Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take.In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy andexplain how these consequences shape your position.Spending at least one semester studying in a foreign country is an appealing and realistic proposal for driven university students. Whether or not this should be a mandatory high-education requirement, however, greatly depends on how they regard the opportunity. Will they focus exclusively on their studies or will they assume the role of ambassadors for their countries? If we want students to expand their academic and non-academic experiences, we should encourage them to study in a foreign country for at least one semester, but should not make it a compulsory requirement. 如果希望丰富学生们的学术以及非学术经验，我们应该鼓励他们在国外学习至少一个学期；但我认为，不应该把这条建议当做一个强制要求。Not all students are well-suited to study abroad. 因为并不是所有学生都能很好地适应海外留学。Assimilating into a foreign culture entails a comprehensive understanding of that culture. 融入一国文化需要对这种文化具备全面的理解。This is unlikely if the student lacks language proficiency, 如果学生缺乏熟练的外语，那这点便不大可能实现。However, acquiring sufficient language proficiency so as to have little difficulty communicating both academically and in their daily lives, is incredibly time-consuming. 然而，在学习和日常生活两方面，掌握熟练外语以实现零障碍交流是极为耗时的。THis makes overseas study a desirable choice exclusively for those already proficient in the target language. 这就使得海外留学只针对那些熟练掌握外语的学生来说，才是一个可取的选项。For example, while an english major student might benefit tremendously from immersion in an English-speaking country, requiring a Japanese Literature major student, who is Japanese, to pursue his/her study in an English-speaking country is unreasonable when he/she would receive better instruction in his/her own country. 比如，尽管能够浸染在一个英语国家对于英语专业的学生来说无疑是一个莫大的恩惠，但如果要求一个主修日语文学的专业的日本学生，前往英语国家继续学业则是不合理的，因为他/她明明可以在自己国家接受更好的教育。It may even be disastrous to compel an American freshman study in a Chines university, if his/her rudimentary Chinese language skills would preclude him/her from a wholehearted immersion in Chinese culture and consequently inflame his/her eager of returning to his/her home country. 如果强迫一个美国大学新生在一所中国大学里求学，其结果也可能是灾难性的，因为中文水平低将阻碍他/她吸收中国文化，并可能进一步刺激他/她想要回国的欲望。On the other hand, if we are discussing whether to require every student to become an exchange students, the issue if far more complex and therefore necessitates a more thorough examination. 另一方面，如果我们在讨论“是否要让每一个学生都成为交换生”，那么这个问题将变得极为复杂，因此需要更为详细的检视。Firstly, it is expensive to live and study in a foreign country. 首先，在国外学习，生活开销不菲。Even if the government assumed the expense, it would still be impossible to provide every student with such an opportunity. 即便政府承担费用，但为每一个学生提供这样的机会还是显得不实际。More importantly, exchange student programs are designed in the hope that students from two counties could contribute to the multicultural communication. 更为重要的是，交换生项目存在的初衷是：希望两国学生能够为多边文化交流的建立做贡献。Such a contribution depends on how ell the students embody their country's most valuable characteristics and whether they are able to express and convey those in a friendly and explicit way. 这样一种贡献取决于学生能在多大程度上展现他们国家最为宝贵的特质，以及他们能否以一种友好且明确的方式将其表达和传递。Moreover, exchange students should possess an intense passion for various cultures and an appreciation for multiculturalism. 另外，交换生应该对各类文化抱有极高的热情并且乐于欣赏多元主义。Therefore, colleges and universities should adopt a selection method that would provide only elite students who personify these characteristics with the opportunity to study abroad. 因此，各所学院和大学应该采取“只向精英学生开放”的甄选模式，因为他们能够通过海外学习的机会完美呈现本国的优秀特质。As a result, the students selected would represent their nation well and also gain a wealth of experience in foreign countries. 因此，被选中的学生将很好地代表自己的国家，并且在海外收货丰富的留学经历。However, if we give this opportunity to students indiscriminately, the goal of multicultural communication will be jeopardized. 然而，如果我们不加区别地向学生提供机会，多元文化交流的目标将因此而受损。In addition, while communication with different culture is appealing and indispensable for a university student, not only does such communication result from an overseas experience, but it can be also achieved through introduction of foreign teacher into students' home country. 另外，尽管跨国文化交流是具有吸引力且不可或缺的，但对于大学生来说，这样的交流不只能来源于海外留学，也可以通过引进外籍教师来实现。This alternative policy demonstrates advantages when students cannot afford the expense of overseas study and is thereby presumable desirable in some developing countries. 当学生们无法支付海外留学的费用时，这条替代性政策将显示其优势，并且因此可能在发展中国家受到广泛的欢迎。TO draw a conclusion, no matter students perceive the opportunity to study abroad, they should always be asked whether or not they want to do so, as well as whether or not they are capable of doing so. Besides, when it comes to a case where exchange students are selected, we should guarantee that only those who sufficiently embody their countries are provided with opportunities. Moreover when alternative options emerge, which outshine the proposed one in this issue task in terms of financial factors, we should better adopt the former ones. ArgumentArgument]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[“知其然，知其所以然”前言通过了解异步设计的由来，来深入理解异步事件机制什么是异步同步并发(Concurrency)线程(Thread)I/O多路复用异步(Asynchronous)回调(Callback)项目地址参考文献什么是异步为了深入理解异步的概念，就必须先了解异步设计的由来。同步显然易见的是，同步的概念随着我们学习第一个输出Hello World的程序，就已经深入人心。然而我们也很容易忘记一个事实：一个现代编程语言(如Python)做了非常多的工作，来指导和约束你如何去构建你自己的一个程序。123456def f(): print("in f()")def g(): print("in g()")f()g()你知道in g()一定输出在in f()之后，即函数f完成前函数g不会执行。这即为同步。在现代编程语言的帮助下，这一切显得非常的自然，从而也让我们可以将我们的程序分解成松散耦合的函数：一个函数并不需要关心谁调用了它，它甚至可以没有返回值，只是完成一些操作。当然关于这些是怎么具体实现的就不探究了，然而随着一个程序的功能的增加，同步设计的开发理念并不足以实现一些复杂的功能。并发写一个程序每隔3秒打印“Hello World”，同时等待用户命令行的输入。用户每输入一个自然数n，就计算并打印斐波那契函数的值F(n)，之后继续等待下一个输入由于等待用户输入是一个阻塞的操作，如果按照同步的设计理念：如果用户未输入，则意味着接下来的函数并不会执行，自然没有办法做到一边输出“Hello World”，一边等待用户输入。为了让程序能解决这样一个问题，就必须引入并发机制，即让程序能够同时做很多事，线程是其中一种。线程具体代码在example/hello_threads.py中。12345678910111213141516171819202122from threading import Threadfrom time import sleepfrom time import timefrom fib import timed_fibdef print_hello(): while True: print("&#123;&#125; - Hello world!".format(int(time()))) sleep(3)def read_and_process_input(): while True: n = int(input()) print('fib(&#123;&#125;) = &#123;&#125;'.format(n, timed_fib(n)))def main(): # Second thread will print the hello message. Starting as a daemon means # the thread will not prevent the process from exiting. t = Thread(target=print_hello) t.daemon = True t.start() # Main thread will read and process input read_and_process_input()if __name__ == '__main__': main()对于之前那样的问题，引入线程机制就可以解决这种简单的并发问题。而对于线程我们应该有一个简单的认知：一个线程可以理解为指令的序列和CPU执行的上下文的集合。一个同步的程序即进程，有且只会在一个线程中运行，所以当线程被阻塞，也就意味着整个进程被阻塞一个进程可以有多个线程，同一个进程中的线程共享了进程的一些资源，比如说内存，地址空间，文件描述符等。线程是由操作系统的调度器来调度的， 调度器统一负责管理调度进程中的线程。系统的调度器决定什么时候会把当前线程挂起，并把CPU的控制器交个另一个线程。这个过程称之为称上下文切换，包括对于当前线程上下文的保存、对目标线程上下文的加载。上下文切换会对性能产生影响，因为它本身也需要CPU的周期来执行I/O多路复用而随着现实问题的复杂化，如10K问题。在Nginx没有流行起来的时候，常被提到一个词 10K（并发1W）。在互联网的早期，网速很慢、用户群很小需求也只是简单的页面浏览，所以最初的服务器设计者们使用基于进程/线程模型，也就是一个TCP连接就是分配一个进程(线程)。谁都没有想到现在Web 2.0时候用户群里和复杂的页面交互问题，而现在即时通信和实在实时互动已经很普遍了。那么你设想如果每一个用户都和服务器保持一个（甚至多个）TCP连接才能进行实时的数据交互，别说BAT这种量级的网站，就是豆瓣这种比较小的网站，同时的并发连接也要过亿了。进程是操作系统最昂贵的资源，一台机器无法创建很多进程。如果要创建10K个进程，那么操作系统是无法承受的。就算我们不讨论随着服务器规模大幅上升带来复杂度几何级数上升的问题，采用分布式系统，只是维持1亿用户在线需要10万台服务器，成本巨大，也只有FLAG、BAT这样公司才有财力购买如此多的服务器。而同样存在一些原因，让我们避免考虑多线程的方式：线程在计算和资源消耗的角度来说是比较昂贵的。线程并发所带来的问题，比如因为共享的内存空间而带来的死锁和竞态条件。这些又会导致更加复杂的代码，在编写代码的时候需要时不时地注意一些线程安全的问题。为了解决这一问题，出现了「用同一进程/线程来同时处理若干连接」的思路，也就是I/O多路复用。以Linux操作系统为例，Linux操作系统给出了三种监听文件描述符的机制，具体实现可参考：select: 每个连接对应一个描述符（socket），循环处理各个连接，先查下它的状态，ready了就进行处理，不ready就不进行处理。但是缺点很多：每次调用select，都需要把fd集合从用户态拷贝到内核态，这个开销在fd很多时会很大同时每次调用select都需要在内核遍历传递进来的所有fd，这个开销在fd很多时也很大select支持的文件描述符数量太小了，默认是1024poll: 本质上和select没有区别，但是由于它是基于链表来存储的，没有最大连接数的限制。缺点是：大量的的数组被整体复制于用户态和内核地址空间之间，而不管这样的复制是不是有意义。poll的特点是「水平触发(只要有数据可以读，不管怎样都会通知)」，如果报告后没有被处理，那么下次poll时会再次报告它。epoll: 它使用一个文件描述符管理多个描述符，将用户关系的文件描述符的事件存放到内核的一个事件表中，这样在用户空间和内核空间的copy只需一次。epoll支持水平触发和边缘触发，最大的特点在于「边缘触发」，它只告诉进程哪些刚刚变为就绪态，并且只会通知一次。使用epoll的优点很多：没有最大并发连接的限制，能打开的fd的上限远大于1024（1G的内存上能监听约10万个端口）效率提升，不是轮询的方式，不会随着fd数目的增加效率下降内存拷贝，利用mmap()文件映射内存加速与内核空间的消息传递；即epoll使用mmap减少复制开销综上所述，通过epoll的机制，给现代高级语言提供了高并发、高性能解决方案的基础。而同样FreeBSD推出了kqueue，Windows推出了IOCP，Solaris推出了/dev/poll。而在Python3.4中新增了selectors模块，用于封装各个操作系统所提供的I/O多路复用的接口。那么之前同样的问题，我们可以通过I/O多路复用的机制实现并发。写一个程序每隔3秒打印“Hello World”，同时等待用户命令行的输入。用户每输入一个自然数n，就计算并打印斐波那契函数的值F(n)，之后继续等待下一个输入通过最基础的轮询机制(poll)，轮询标准输入(stdin)是否变为可读的状态，从而当标准输入能被读取时，去执行计算Fibonacci数列。然后判断时间是否过去三秒钟，从而是否输出”Hello World!”.具体代码在example/hello_selectors_poll.py中。注意：在Windows中并非一切都是文件，所以该实例代码无法在Windows平台下运行。123456789101112131415161718192021222324import selectorsimport sysfrom time import timefrom fib import timed_fibdef process_input(stream): text = stream.readline() n = int(text.strip()) print('fib(&#123;&#125;) = &#123;&#125;'.format(n, timed_fib(n)))def print_hello(): print("&#123;&#125; - Hello world!".format(int(time())))def main(): selector = selectors.DefaultSelector() # Register the selector to poll for "read" readiness on stdin selector.register(sys.stdin, selectors.EVENT_READ) last_hello = 0 # Setting to 0 means the timer will start right away while True: # Wait at most 100 milliseconds for input to be available for event, mask in selector.select(0.1): process_input(event.fileobj) if time() - last_hello &gt; 3: last_hello = time() print_hello()if __name__ == '__main__': main()从上面解决问题的设计方案演化过程，从同步到并发，从线程到I/O多路复用。可以看出根本思路去需要程序本身高效去阻塞，让CPU能够执行核心任务。意味着将数据包处理，内存管理，处理器调度等任务从内核态切换到应用态，操作系统只处理控制层，数据层完全交给应用程序在应用态中处理。极大程度的减少了程序在应用态和内核态之间切换的开销，让高性能、高并发成为了可能。异步通过之前的探究，不难发现一个同步的程序也能通过操作系统的接口实现“并发”，而这种“并发”的行为即可称之为异步。之前通过I/O复用的所提供的解决方案，进一步抽象，即可抽象出最基本的框架事件循环(Event Loop)，而其中最容易理解的实现，则是回调(Callback).回调通过对事件本身的抽象，以及其对应的处理函数(handler)，可以实现如下算法：维护一个按时间排序的事件列表，最近需要运行的定时器在最前面。这样的话每次只需要从头检查是否有超时的事件并执行它们。bisect.insort使得维护这个列表更加容易，它会帮你在合适的位置插入新的定时器事件组。具体代码在example/hello_event_loop_callback.py中。注意：在Windows中并非一切都是文件，所以该实例代码无法在Windows平台下运行。12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455from bisect import insortfrom fib import timed_fibfrom time import timeimport selectorsimport sysclass EventLoop(object): """ Implements a callback based single-threaded event loop as a simple demonstration.
