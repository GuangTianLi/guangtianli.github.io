132</h2><blockquote><p>The following appeared in a letter to the school board in the town of Centerville.</p><div class="tooltip">All students should be required to take the driver's education course at Centerville High School. In the past two years, several accidents in and around Centerville have involved teenage drivers. Since a number of parents in Centerville have complained that they are too busy to teach their teenagers to drive, some othe instruction is necessary to ensure that these teenagers are safe drivers. Although there are two driving schools in Centerville, parents on a tight budget cannot afford to pay for driving instruction. Therefore an effective and mandatory program sponsored by the high school is the only solution to this serious problem <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip"><p><span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></p></div><div class="tooltip">Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p></blockquote><div class="tooltip">In the letter, the writer recommends an initiation of a high-school-sponsored driver's education course program and predicts that such a program will help solve the teenage driving problem in Centerville. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">While this program might be beneficial to some extent, the reasoning of this argument is unconvincing due to several unsubstantiated assumptions which, if proven unwarranted, will seriously challenge the author's recommendation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">First of all, the writer's recommendation relies heavily on the assumption that the driving problem involving teenage drivers in the town of Centerville is serious enough to require immediate measures be taken. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，作者的建议很大程度上建立在这样一个假设上：发生在Centerville镇的青少年驾驶问题已经严重到需要立即采取行动。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Based on such an assumption, the writer therefore proposes formal instruction to ensure that these teenagers become safe drivers. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">基于这一假设，作者提出通过正式教学让这些青少年驾驶员学会安全驾驶。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, this assumption is potentially problematic because we are not informed with the exact number of the accidents. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，这一假设可能是有问题的，因为我们并不知道事故的确切数目。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Nor do we know whether the teenage drivers are to blame for thee accidents. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">我们同样不知道事故是否是青少年驾驶员的责任。</span></div><div class="tooltip">In addition, we even have no idea whether or not the teenage drivers are local. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，我们甚至无法得知这些青少年驾驶员是否是本地人。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If it turns out that the accidents are not sufficiently serious, or they could be attributed to factors other than the local teenage drivers' negligence, then the author's argument for a proposed driver education program is unconvincing. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果这些事故并不那么严重，或他们并非由于本地青少年驾驶员的疏忽而导致的，那么作者提出建立驾校的项目的论点就是没有说服力的。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">In addition, by starting that parents have either little time or funding to provide their teenagers with driving courses, the writer rules out alternative methods which could rival the proposed driving program. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">不仅如此，作者认为家长们要么没有时间，要么没有钱让他们的孩子上驾驶课程，由此排出了驾校之外的替代方案。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, we need to re-examine the assumption that the driving program is the only solution to the teenage driving problem. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，我们需要考察驾校项目是否是解决青少年驾驶问题的唯一方案。</span></div><div class="tooltip">It is likely that the so-called busy parents just use their unavailability as an excuse because they are reluctant to teach. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">那些自称很忙的家长有可能只是以此为借口掩饰他们不愿意教孩子的事实。</span></div><div class="tooltip">It is of equal possibility that parent with limited budget make up only a minority of parents. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">经济捉襟见肘的家长可能只是一小部分人。</span></div><div class="tooltip">In addition, government-sponsored driving courses could also serve as an alternative method. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，由政府资助的驾驶课程也可以作为替代方案。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If any of these possibilities is true, then we are inclined to believe that other solutions could overshado the one proposed to solve the driving problem. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">假使真实情况符合上述任一可能性，其他的解决方案可能会让作者的建议相形见绌。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Even if the assumptions mentioned above are valid, the writer's recommendation could be unnecessary due to the doubtful assumption regarding the efficiency of the proposed driving program. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">即使上述假设是有根据的，若不能证明驾驶项目是有效的，你们作者的建议也可能是没必要的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Claiming that this program will be effective, the writer might be too optimistic. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">作者可能对项目的有效性过于乐观了。</span></div><div class="tooltip">It is unreasonable to assume that all parents, including those who would like to teach their teenagers personally, will readily accept such a school-sponsored mandatory driving instruction program. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">假如所有家长，包括哪些想亲自教孩子的家长在内，都乐意接受这一学校资助的强制性驾校计划，是不合理的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Also, the writer hastily comes to the conclusion that the local high school should sponsor this program but does not discuss whether the school is financially capable of doing so. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">另外，作者草率地总结本地高中应该资助这一项目，却没有讨论学校的财力是否足以承担。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Furthermore, we cannot be sure that there wil be fewer accidents involving local teenage drivers after the implementation of the proposed recommendation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，我们无法确定建议实施后，本地青少年驾驶员所导致的事故数量是否会减少。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If this program provokes general discontent amongt parents or the school cannot afford such a program, then the recommendation may not be enacted and we cannot therefore expect a decrease in the number of driving accidents in Centerville. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果此项目在家长中引发普遍不满或学校的财力无法承担，那么该计划将不会被推行，而我们也无法预测Centerville的事故是否会减少。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">To summarize, whether or not we should implement the writer's recommendation depends greatly on the validity of the assumptions in the argument. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">If these assumptions prove unwarranted, then the recommendation will be little more than the writer's wishful thinking, and accordingly we need to consider other solutions to the teenage driving problem in Centerville. <span class="main-inner

62</h2><blockquote><p>The following appeared in a memo from the director of a large group of hospitals.</p><div class="tooltip">In a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps, a concentrated solution of UltraClean produced a 40 percent greater reduction in the bacteria population than the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals. During a subsequent test of UltraClean at our hospital in Workby, that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group. Therefore, to prevent serious patient infections, we should supply UltraClean at all hand-washing stations throughout our hospital system. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip"><p><span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></p></div><div class="tooltip">Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p></blockquote><div class="tooltip">In this memo, the author recommends supplying UltraClean to all hand-washing stations throughout the hospital system to provent serious patient infections. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">To support his/her suggestion, the director presents two separate studies, one conducted in a lab and the other in the field. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Although UltraClean may indeed help reduce the occurrences of infections, information currently available is not conclusive because there are several unsubstantiated assumptions in the author's reasoning. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">The director's recommendation will be seriously challenged if these assumptions prove to be unwarranted. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">To start with, the laboratory study shows that a concentrated solution of UltraClean is excellent at reducing the number of bacteria. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，那项实验室表明UltraClean的浓缩溶液在减少细菌数量上表现出色。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Based on an unstated assumption that the non-concentrated version of UltraClean is similarly effective, the director endorses the use of regular UltraClean in the hospitals. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">主任基于没有言明的假设，即UltraClean的非浓缩版本有同样的功效，赞同在医院使用普通版的UltraClean。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, this assumption is potentially problematic because intuitively speaking a concentrated solution of UltraClean may naturally outperform the non-concentrated version. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，这个假设可能是有问题的，因为就直觉而言，UltraClean的浓缩溶液自然会优于非浓缩版本。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Even if we acknowledge this assumption, UltraClean may not necessarily be as effective as the liquid hand soap currently used in the hospitals. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">即使我们承认这一假设，UltraClean也不一定像目前医院使用的液体洗手皂一样有效。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If this is the case, the director's assumption will not hold and his/her recommendation will be clearly weakened. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果是这样的话，主任的假设不能成立，他的建议也将被明显削弱。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Additionally, the Workby hospital field study demonstrating that UltraClean use in hospitals can reduce cases of patient infections requires further examination. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，我们需要进一步考察Workby医院的实地研究，该研究证明在医院使用UltraClean可以减少患者感染的病例。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Whether or not UltraClean should be credited for this depends upon the assumption that Workby hospitals are comparable to those in other areas. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">（患者感染的减少）是否归功于UltraClean，这取决于Workby医院和其他地区的是否具有可比性。</span></div><div class="tooltip">For example, if the Workby hospital is extremely small and only receives a handful of patients each day, it would not be a surprise to see fewer numbers of infections. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">例如，如果Workby医院的规模很小，明天仅接收少量的患者，你们有更少数量的感染并不奇怪。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Moreover, the Workby hospital may be the best-staffed one in the region, and it is their attentiveness and expertise that keeps patient infections in check. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，Workby医院可能是该地区与员工素质最高的医院，员工的专注和专业知识使患者感染得到了控制。</span></div><div class="tooltip">For that reason, UltraClean may not necessarily be the key to few infections in the Workby hospital. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此，UltraClean不一定是Workby医院感染数少的关键原因。</span></div><div class="tooltip">As a result, the value of supplying UltraClean to other hospitals is debatable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">向其他医院提供UltraClean的建议的价值是有争议的。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Even if we concede the aforementioned assumptions, the recommendation may still not be advisable because UltraClean is not shown to deal specifically with serious infections. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">即使我们承认上述假设为真，该建议仍可能是不可取的，因为我们不知道UltraClean是否能专门应对严重感染。</span></div><div class="tooltip">The lab and field studies focused little, if at all, on serious infections. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">实验室和实地研究几乎没有关注严重感染。</span></div><div class="tooltip">THe director's recommendation here essentially relies on the two assumptions: <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">主任的建议本质上建立在李广假设上：</span></div><div class="tooltip">(1)serious infections are caused by bacteria and (2) regular and serious infections are caused by a common agent which UltraClean can effectively eliminate. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">1）细菌导致严重感染；2）普通感染和严重感染都是由UltraClean可以有效消除的同一媒介物引起的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Both of these assumptions need more support. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">这两个假设都需要更多的支持。</span></div><div class="tooltip">It is not impossible that serious infections are drastically different in terms of its pathological nature and are caused by viruses or parasites rather than bacteria. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">就病理性质而言，严重感染是截然不同的，它可能是由病毒或寄生虫而不是细菌引起的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">In this case, it is very questionable if UltraClean, which only proves to be able to fight bacteria and reduce normal level of infections, can satisfactorily prevent serious patient infections. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">在这种情况下，只被证明能抗菌和降低普通感染的UltraClean能否有效防止严重的患者感染是非常可疑的。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">To sum up, whether or not serious patient infections can be prevented by the use of UltraClean is still questionable and worth further investigation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">The answer could turn out ot be positive, but only after the author can reasonably demonstrate the validity of his/her assumptions by offering more compelling evidence <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><p></p><h2 id="Homework-Every-Day-137"><a href="#Homework-Every-Day-137" class="headerlink" title="Homework Every Day - 137"></a>Homework Every Day - 137</h2><blockquote><div class="tooltip">While the Department of Education in the state of Attra recommends that high school students be assigned homework every day, the data from a recent statewide survey of high school math and science teachers give us reason to question the usefulness of daily homework. In the district of Sanlee, 86 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five times a week, whereas in the district Marlee, less than 25 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five time a week. Yet the students in Marlee earn better grades overall and are less likely to be required to repeat a year of school than are the students in Sanlee. Therefore, all teachers in our high schools should assign homework no more than twice a week <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip"><p><span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></p></div><div class="tooltip">Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what teh implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p></blockquote><div class="tooltip">The author of this argument casts doubt on the recommendation of the Department of Education in Attra state about daily assigned homework. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Data about the frequency of homework assignments and students' academic performance in the districts of Sanlee and Marlee, serve to demonstrate daily homework's minor contribution to a decent education. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">The author therefore claims that students in Attra should not be assigned homework more than twice a week. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">However, such a conclusion cannot be readily arrived at because of several unsubstantiated assumptions. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">If these assumptions prove unwarranted, the argument will be seriously undermined, thus compelling us to reconsider the significant of daily homework. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">To start off, the author's conclusion fundamentally relies on the assumption that the frequency in assigning homework is equal to the amount of homework, or more specifically, the time students are expected to spend on homework. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，作者的结论基本上依赖于这一假设：留作业的频次等同于作业量的大小，或者更具体而言，学生在作业上预计要花费的时间。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Even though the data reveals that a smaller number of teachers in Marlee assign homework three to five times a week, it is imprudent to assume that students in Marlee are thereby under less pressure than those in Sanlee. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">虽然数据显示Marlee地区的教师很少一周布置3~5次作业，但就此假设Marlee学生所承担的压力比Sanlee学生更小是轻率的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">It is highly likely that even though teachers in Marlee assign homework ess frequently, the formidable difficulty of this homework may cost students more time; <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">很有可能虽然Marlee的教师更少布置作业，但作业的超高难度会让学生花费更多的时间；</span></div><div class="tooltip">it is of equal possibility that while students in Marlee may receive modest amounts of homework from their math and science teachers, such an amount is offset by that assigned by teachers in other subjects. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">还有可能虽然Marlee的数学和科学老师给学生布置的作业更少，但这一差距却被其他科目的老师布置的更多作业所抵消。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If either of the previous scenarios turns out to be true, then the assumption that students in Marlee spend less time on homework is disproved and the suggestion to assign homework less frequently is unreasonable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果任何上述情况为真的话，那么假设Marlee的学生花更少的时间做作业，从而认为更少布置作业的建议是不合理的。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Moreover, the author unfairly assumes that students in Marlee generally excel at schoolwork based on overall better grades and less likelihood to repeat a year. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，作者基于更好的分数和更少的留级情况判断Marlee的学生课业表现更好的假设也是不当的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, these two factors do not necessarily represent excellent academic performance, let alone indicate a successful education system. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">这两个因素并不一定能代表优秀的学业表现，更不用说表明教育制度是否成功。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If schools in Marlee and Sanlee adopt different, even distinct standards of grading their students, it is not surprising that there would be variations in students' scores. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果Marlee和Sanlee的学校采用不甚相同甚至大相径庭的标准来给学生评分，那么学生分数的不同也就不会让我们惊讶了。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Additionally, Marlee district school may be attempting to prevent their academic reputation from declining by allowing students with poor academic performance to graduate. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，Marlee地区的学校为了捍卫学术声誉可能会允许学业不佳的学生毕业。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Both ot hers two cases serve to undermine the facts presented by the author as good indicators of students' excellence at school. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">这两种情况都会削弱作者以成绩和留级作为学生消息优秀与否的指标的可信度。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If either of these circumstances proves to be true,then there is reason to doubt the validity of students' academic performance in Marlee. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果上述任一情况被证明为真，那么我们就有理由怀疑Marlee学生的学术表现。</span></div><div class="tooltip">As a a result, teachers in Marlee who assign less homework are not an example that we should follow. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此，布置更少作业的Marlee也就不是我们应当遵循的例子了。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Last, the author's argument also suffers from a questionable assumption which hastily generalizes the situation of high schools in Marlee to those in Attra. <span class="main-inner

from several questionable assumptions, which, if not justified, would negatively influence the soundness of this argument. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">First, when discussing the connection between the executives' sleeping hours and the financial performance of their firms, the author apparently assumes that these executives should receive most, if not all, the credit for higher profits margins and faster growth. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，在讨论高管的睡眠时间和他们公司的财务表现之间的联系时，作者想当然地认为更高的利润和更快的增长率都应当归功于这些高管。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, common sense informs as that any company's excellent performance derives from combined efforts of every single unit within that company. <span class="main-inner

employee's contributions would be both unfair and unreasonable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">尽管身处高位的人，例如高管，可能会对公司产生更大的影响力，但忽视其他雇员的努力既不公平，也不合理。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Therefore, while I admit that the advertising executives might play an essential role in their firm's operation, once the participation of others also proves significant to the development of the firms, the assumption would be undermined that we should ascribe the healthy performance of these firms to their advertising executives, and the conclusion of this argument is also rendered in jeopardy. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此，虽然我承认广告公司的高管在公司经营中可能扮演着关键角色，但若其他人的参与也被证明对公司的发展十分重要，你们“广告公司的强劲表现归功于他们的高管”这一假设就会被推翻，而从这一点推导出的论点也就站不住脚了。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Even if the advertising executives should be honored for their contributions to their firms' excellent financial performance, the validity of this argument may also be impaired by another dubious assumption, the one which attributes these executives' capabilities to the amount of sleep they require, namely, 6 hours per night. <span class="main-inner

require and their work performance, we cannot easily see hwo 6 hours is applicable to everyone to perform their best at work. <span class="main-inner

exhaust these executives that they cannot sleep longer than 6 hours; this is to say, even better performance may result if they sleep longer. <span class="main-inner

vote against the author's proposal to only hire those who nee less than 6 hours of sleep per night. <span class="main-inner

from their executives' outstanding capacity and that this capacity is attributable to their 6-hours sleep per night, whether the author's suggestion is advisable highly depends on the soundness of the assumption that the executives performance and that of their firms can be generalized to other staff as well as to business world. <span class="main-inner

circumstances cannot be easily applied to staff who occupy different roles; likewise, it would be irrational to draw hasty generalizations based on one firm. <span class="main-inner

bicycle safety education instead of emphasizing the necessity of waring a helmet while riding a bicycle. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">What underlies such a

suffer from the absence of critical information and are thereby liable to be invalidated. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Once proved unwarranted, these

while we are informed of the significant increase in both the percentage of bicycle-related accidents and people who claim to wear helmets, we cannot safely assume that an increasing number of people

whether or not the number of people who report wearing helmets, both in proportion an in number, has greatly increased depends on their truthfulness. <span class="main-inner

unwarranted. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Moreover, if the 200 percent increase in bicycle-related accidents results from an increase in bicyclists, which is highly likely given the ten-year time period, or if the accidents should not be ascribed to carelessness of the bicyclists, but instead to car drivers or pedestrian, then the assumption is untenable that bicyclists tend to take more risk. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">As a result, the author's recommendation si rendered questionable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Even if the aforementioned assumptions remain tenable, it is worthwhile examining the soundness of another assumption that it is the helmets that led to bicyclists' likelihood to take more risks and finally result in more accidents. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">In this argument, the author clearly regards the increased percentages of people claiming to wear helmets and the bicycle-related accidents as a causal relationship. <span class="main-inner

occurred. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">If it was the ones who did not wear helmets while bicycling that caused the accidents, then we should not find fault

class="tooltip">Granted that wearing a helmet does increase a bicyclist's propensity to take risks and consequently gave rise to increasing accidents, we should still be cautious about the assumption that helmets contributed little to the protection of these bicyclists involved in the accidents; <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">it is of equal significance that we remain alert to the assumption that educating people about bicycle safety functions well in reducing the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents. <span class="main-inner

large, highly diversified company.</p><div class="tooltip">Ten years ago our company had two new office buildings constructed as regional headquarters fro two regions. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">The building were erected by different construction companies-Alpha and Zeta. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Although the two buildings had identical floor plans, the building constructed by Zeta cost 30 percent more to build. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">However, that building's expenses ofr maintenance last year were only half those of Alpha's. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">In addition, the energy consumption of the Zeta building has been lower than that of the Alpha building every year since its construction. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Given these data, plus the fact that Zeta has a stable workforce with little employee turnover, we recommend using Zeta rather than Alpha for our new building project, even though Alpha's bid promises lower construction costs. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip"><p><span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></p></div><div class="tooltip">Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p></blockquote><div class="tooltip">In this letter, the vice president of a large company recommends using Zeta instead of Alpha for their newly proposed building project. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">THe vice president insists that Zeta is a better choice despite Alpha's more competitive bid because of buildings Alpha and Zeta constructed ten years previously. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Although Zeta's construction costs were higher than Alpha's, its building's maintenance costs and energy consumption have been lower than those of the Alpha-constructed building. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Moreover, the vice president cites Zeta's stable workforce and low turnover rate in hopes of proving Zeta's competency. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Although this argument may seem quite convincing at first glance, the vice president does not conclusively justify his/her endorsement of Zeta. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">More evidence is needed in order to fully assess the vice president's recommendation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">To begin with, more information about maintenance costs and energy consumption of the two building is needed. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，我们需要更多关于两栋建筑的维护成本和能耗的信息。</span></div><div class="tooltip">This is because the vice president implies that the difference in maintenance costs and energy consumption is due to Zeta and Alpha's work quality. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">这是因为副总裁暗示了Zeta和Alpha的工作质量造成了不同的维护成本和能耗。</span></div><div class="tooltip">This could be wrong, however, because environmental factors can also affect both maintenance costs and energy consumption. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，这可能是是错的，因为环境因素也可能会影响维护成本和能耗。</span></div><div class="tooltip">For example, the building Alpha erected may be located in a region with a cold, harsh climate and frequent extreme weather, which would result in higher maintenance costs due to weather damage and more expensive energy bills due to higher heating demands. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">例如，Alpha所建的建筑可能地处寒冷恶劣的读取，时常遭遇极端天气，天气造成的损坏导致了更高的维护成本，而对暖气的更多需求导致了更高昂的电费账单。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If the evidence suggests this, the vice president's argument will be considerably weakened. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果有证据能证明这一点，那么副总裁的论点就会被大大削弱。</span></div><div class="tooltip">On the other hand, if evidence indicates a close similarity between the two regions in terms of natural conditions, the vice president's comparison is more reasonable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">另一方面，如果证据表明两栋建筑所处地的自然条件非常接近，你们副总裁的比较久显得更为合理了。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Even if higher maintenance costs and energy consumption are the direct result of Alpha's construction, it is unclear whether the Alpha-constructed building's total costs are higher than the building erected by Zeta. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">即使是Alpha的建设直接导致了更高的维护成本和能耗，我们也不清楚Alpha所建建筑的总成本是否高于Zeta所建的建筑。</span></div><div class="tooltip">By hte total cost, I refer to the sum of construction costs and subsequent operation costs. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">所谓总成本指的是建筑成本好后续运营成本之和。</span></div><div class="tooltip">The vice president mentions that the Zeta building's construction costs were higher so it is possible that Zeta;s building was more expensive in terms of total cost. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">副总裁提到Zeta的建筑成本更高，所以就总成本而言，Zeta建筑可能更为昂贵。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, a lack of quantified information prevents detailed evaluation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，缺乏量化信息让我们无法做出详细评估。</span></div><div class="tooltip">We certainly need the exact construction costs and operation figures over the past ten years to determine which company actually offers a better economical solution. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">无疑，我们需要确切的建筑成本和过去十年的运营数据来决定哪家公司的方案更为经济。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">What is more, even if the Zeta building's overall costs i lower than the Alpha building's, whether or not Zeta should win the contract remains questionable because const should not be the only factor considered. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">更主要的是，即使Zeta建筑的总成本低于Alpha公司，由于成本不应当是唯一考虑的因素，我们对是否应该签约Zeta公司仍然存疑。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Besides cost, factors such as building quality, safety standards and speediness of construction ought to be taken into consideration. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">在成本之外，诸如建筑质量、安全标准和作业速度之类的因素也应当被考虑在内。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If Zeta's building, though cheaper, is very shabby or contains high levels of toxic materials which pose a serious health threat to its inhabitants, it would be dangerous to give Zeta the project. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">虽然Zeta的建筑更便宜，但如果它非常破旧或含有高剂量的有毒物质，对其居民构成了严重的健康威胁，那么让Zeta负责项目是非常危险的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">On hte contrary, a report from a certified independent quality-control agency endorsing the Zeta building's overall quality would certainly boost the vice president's recommendation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">相反，若有来自经认证的独立质量控制机构的报告为Zeta建筑的整体质量背书，那么副总裁的建议就获得了大力支持。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Additionally, the author mentions that Zeta has low employee turnover and thus has a more stable workforce. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，作者提到了Zeta的员工流动率更低，因此拥有更稳定的工作队伍。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, it is not clear whether a company's stability is equivalent to its service quality. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，我们并不清除一家公司工作队伍的稳定性是否等同于它的服务质量。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Alpha's allegedly higher turnover rate (though this has not yet been established) could result from strong intra-company competition which results in the dismissal fo underperforming employees. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">所谓Alpha更高的流动率（虽然这还没被证实）可能是因为激烈的公司的内部竞争，那些表现不佳的员工被解雇了。</span></div><div class="tooltip">In this case, Zeta's superiority over Alpha is hardly proven. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">在这种情况下，Zeta并不一定优于Alpha。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Feedback from the two company's previous clients regarding employee performance would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of teh true quality of each company's employees. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">两家公司服务过的客户对员工表现的反馈能让我们对其员工的真实素质作出更全面的评估。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">In conclusion, although the vice president provides some information to support his/her argument, there are still some problems with his/her lines of reasoning. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Zeta may indeed be a good candidate but we cannot logically draw this conclusion based solely on the information provided by teh vice president. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">More evidence is needed to determine whether Alpha or Zeta should be selected as the new project's contractor. <span class="main-inner

efficiency of Ichthaid-a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil-in preventing colds and further asserts the capability of Ichthaid to lower absenteeism in local schools and workplaces. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">To buttress his/her recommendation, the author cites a study showing high fish consumption and low doctor-visiting frequency in Meria. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">We are also informed that colds are the most frequently given reason for absences from local school and work. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">However, close scrutiny of this argument reveals a great lack of critical evidences and we are therefore unable to evaluate the

class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">To start with, while the author provides information concerning the high fish consumption and less frequent medical visits for the treatment of colds in Meria, we need more evidence to demonstrate the casual relationship between the former and the latter. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，虽然作者告诉我们在Meria鱼的消费很大，人们找医生看感冒的频率很低，我们仍需要更多的证据来证明这两者之间存在因果关系。</span></div><div class="tooltip">For example, we need to know whether high fish consumption in Meria means that people eat a large amount of fish; <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">例如，我们需要知道在Maria鱼的消费量更高是否意味着人们吃大量的鱼；</span></div><div class="tooltip">in addition, detailed proof will be of great significance to determine whether people visit doctors infrequently because of a lower incidence of catching colds as opposed to other reasons, such as excessively hih hospital fees. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，我们需要更多具体的细节来证明人们更少看病是因为更少得感冒，而不是出自其它理由，例如过于昂贵的医疗费用。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If new evidence shows that people do eat a massive amount of fish and catch colds less often, then fish's efficiency in preventing colds can be confirmed and the author's recommendation is thereby more convincing. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果新的证据能够证明人们确实吃了大量的鱼并且更少得感冒，你们吃鱼对预防感冒有效这一观点可以被确认，作者的建议因此更有说服力了。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">In addition, although the writer claims that the most frequently given reason for absence from local school and work is colds, he/she needs to provide more evidence to validate the assertion. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，虽然作者声称旷工和旷课时人们最常给出的理由是感冒，她/他需要提供更多证据来证实这个主张。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Since absence due to illness is widely accepted in both schools and workplaces, using colds as an excuse not to study or work is naturally a reasonable possibility. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因为学校和职场都接受因病请假，用感冒作为缺席的借口是很合乎情理的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Therefore, we need additional evidence indicating whether people asking for absence have lied about the reasons. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此，我们需要更多证据来说明人们是否会在请假理由上说谎。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If new evidence shows that colds do play as crucial role in absenteeism, the we are disposed to believe that the author's conclusion is advisable. <span class="main-inner

the argument. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">反之，如果证据表明事实恰恰相反，那么我们队这一建议存疑。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Even if new evidence is provided to demonstrate both fish's efficiency in preventing colds as well as the contribution colds make towards local absenteeism, we need more information to show that Ichthaid is as effective, if not more, as fish in the prevention of colds. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">即使新的证据证明了鱼能有效预防感冒且感冒导致了大量旷工和旷课，我们仍然需要更多的证据来证明Ichthaid在预防感冒上比直接吃鱼更有效或至少一样有效。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Specifically, we need to know whether fish's ability to prevent colds originates in its oil and not in any other parts such as the bones. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">具体而言，我们需要知道是否鱼油而不是鱼的其他部位，比如鱼骨，在预防感冒上发挥作用。</span></div><div

in preventing colds. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">不仅如此，通过解释清楚Ichthaid的用法和它对预防感冒的有效性也会帮助作者更好地阐述观点。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If it is fish's bone instead of fish oil that prevents colds,

the second study. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，作者还需要提供证据来证明第二项调查的有效性。</span></div><div class="tooltip">First, the more fact that mystery novels are most frequently checked out of the public

always need to check out those books but can instead read them in the library. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">第二，喜欢某类书籍的人们并不一定要借出这些书，而可以在图书馆中阅读。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If evidence

those who borrowed books from the public libraries. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">第三，第一项调查聚焦于Waymarsh市民，而第二项调查则缩小了范围，只包括从公立图书馆借书的人。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Therefore, it is likely that people who enjoy literary classics could borrow books from private libraries or buy ones directly form bookstores. <span class="main-inner

higher rate of on-the-job accidents at his/her factory and a shorter work shift at nearby Panoply Industries. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">The vice presidents further ascribes the lower number of accidents to the shorter work time. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">While this might be the case, we cannot easily ignore

readily attribute the lower rate of on-the-job accidents at Panoply Industries to a higher level of safety, this is not the only explanation. <span class="main-inner

that a smaller number of employees at Panoply contribute to its comparatively lower rate of accidents. <span class="main-inner

on the kinds of accidents reported. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，我们也应谨慎对待“报告”这个词，这是一个非常主观的词，并且很大程度上依赖于哪些事故种类被选择“报告”。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Therefore, the lower rate of accidents at Panoply could hav resulted from Panoply concealing accidents or could be due to different accidents-reporting standards. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此，Panoply更低的事故率可能是因为他们隐瞒了事故或采集了不同的标准来决定是否报告事故。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Either of these two explanations, once proves true, could easily compete the one proposed by the vice

to attribute this safety solely to its shorter work shifts. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">即使Panoply比副总裁所在的工厂更为安全，我们也不能轻易地认为是更短的轮岗时间提高了生产的安全性。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Generally speaking, a safe working environment originates in a variety of factors: well-experienced employees, advanced and easily operated devices, and scrupulous supervision, any of which could exert a positive influence upon the improvement of safety level of working conditions at Panoply. <span class="main-inner

possibility that Panoply's safe environment stems from any of the aforementioned factors, or a combination of these factors. <span class="main-inner

class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此单纯把Panoply安全的生产环境归功于更短的轮岗时间有欠考虑。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Granted that no other factors contribute to the safe environment at Panoply, the causal relationship between shorter work shifts and fewer accidents is open to doubt. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">即使我们假定并没有其他因素促成Panoply安全的生产环境，更短的轮岗时间和更少的事故数的因果关系也是存疑的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">In this memo, citing the experts' words, the vice president implies that in his/her factory, it is the insufficient sleep, which derives from more accidents <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">在这份备忘录中，副总裁援引了专家的话，认为在他/她的工厂中，较长的轮岗时间让工人睡眠不足，由此导致的疲劳和缺乏睡眠引发了更多的事故。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, even if the experts' words are trustworthy, it is likely that even if the work shifts were shortened, workers at the vice president's factory would spend the time doing other things rather than sleeping. <span class="main-inner

accordingly suffer fatigue and sleep deprivation as much as workers in the vice president's factory do. <span class="main-inner

workers' off-work activities. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">也就是说，该工厂的事故可能是因为工人们下班后的活动所导致的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">I therefore reserve my approval of the vice president's claim which

class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，作者将鱼骨的发现归因于Kaliko岛上人类的捕鱼活动。</span></div><div class="tooltip">While human fishing might well have resulted in the fish bone remains, the latter could have also sprung from other factors. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">虽然人类的捕鱼活动会残留下鱼骨，但鱼骨的出现也可能出自其他因素。</span></div><div class="tooltip">First of all, it is likely that the unearthed fish bones trace back to a

be exclusively attributed to human fishing. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">第二，即使当时已有大量人类在Kaliko岛上居住，也不能将鱼骨完全归因于人类的捕鱼活动。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Instead, it is of equal likelihood that other animals also caught and ate fish and thus contributed to the disappearance of various mammals in the Kaliko Islands. <span class="main-inner

hunting the mammals. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果Kaliko人依赖捕鱼为生，他们也会狩猎哺乳动物。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">In addition, the uncovered simple tools, including stone knives, lend great support to the arguer's explanation that the annihilation of mammal species arises from human hunting. <span class="main-inner

reasons as well. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，这些工具未必如作者声称的那样用于捕猎，而可能有其他用途。</span></div><div class="tooltip">For instance, humans living in the Kaliko Islands could have used those tools to

<span class="main-inner tooltiptext">甚至，有可能这些工具包含了上述所有的用途。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Finally, even if we admit that the uncovered fish bones and those simple tools were used by

id="Abandon-Tradition-74"><a href="#Abandon-Tradition-74" class="headerlink" title="Abandon Tradition - 74"></a>Abandon Tradition - 74</h2><blockquote><div class="tooltip">The president of Grove College has recommended that the college abandon its century-old tradition of all-female education and begin admitting men. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Pointing to other all-female colleges that experienced an increase in applications after adopting coeducation, the president argues that coeducation would lead to a significant increase in applications and enrollment. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">However, the director of the alumnae association opposes the plan. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Arguing that all-female education is essential to the very identity of the college, the director cites annual surveys of incoming students in which these students say that the school's all-female status was the primary reason they selected Grove. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">The director also points to a survey of Grove alumnae in which a majority of respondents strongly favored keeping the college all female. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><p></p></blockquote><div class="tooltip">In this argument, a debate is presented between the president of Grove College and the director of alumnae association regarding abandonment of the college's century-old tradition of all-female education. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Supporting this recommendation, the president cites other all-female colleges that adopted a similar education system and witnessed a subsequent increase in applications. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">On the opposite end of the spectrum is the director of the alumnae association who oppose the plan. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Citing opinions of Grove's incoming students and alumnae, both of whom endorse preserving the all-female tradition, the director argues that such a tradition is an essential college identity. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Plausible as both sides of this debate may appear, in order to decide which recommendation is most reasonable, we need to ask more questions and the answers to these questions might help us settle on the ultimate decision. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">To begin with, we need to raise a series of questions and the answers to these questions might contribute to confirming the causal relationship between the coeducation system and the increase in applications. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，我们需要提出几个问题，这几个问题的答案能帮助我们确认男女同校的教育制度和申请数增长之间是否存在因果关系。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Firstly, even though we are informed that adoption of the coeducation system was followed by an increase in applications in some all-female colleges, we may still wonder whether such an increase could occur in this case. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">第一，即使我们被告知在男女同校后，一些女子学校的申请数获得了增长，我们仍然需要知道这样的增长是否也会发生在Grove。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Normally, an application increase might spring from various factors, such as excellent faculty with strong academic backgrounds, and appealing campus, for example, and in most cases those factors conspire to influence whether students decide to apply. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">通常而言，许多因素可能导致申请数的增长，比如有较强学术背景的优秀教师、引人入胜的校园；在大多数情况下，这些因素会共同作用，影响学生是否决定申请。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Therefore, unless the president gives a positive answer showing that adoption of the coeducation system is the only reason responsible for the applications increase, we remain unconvinced of such a system's efficiency in attracting students. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此，除非校长能够给出肯定的回答，表明采用男女同校是导致申请增长的唯一原因，我们队男女同校能够有效吸引学生这一观点只能存疑。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Secondly, even if the aforementioned causal relationship is confirmed, we need to question whether Grove College will experience a similar application increase by adopting the coeducation system. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">第二，即使我们确认了上述因果关系，我们还需质疑Grove学院采取男女同校后收到的申请是否会有相似的增长。</span></div><div class="tooltip">This question further behooves us to inquire the extent to which Grove College is analogical to other all-female colleges mentioned in the argument. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">该问题进一步要求我们就Grove学院和文中提到的其他女校的相似程度提出疑问。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If the president provides answers to demonstrate sufficient similarities between those colleges and Grove College, then we are inclined to accept his/her recommendation/ <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果校长能够证明Grove和其他学校之间足够相似，那么我们趋向于接受他/她的建议。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Otherwise we reserve our approval. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">否则我们将保留意见。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Similarly, we should also carefully ponder the director's assertion. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">同样的，我们也需要仔细考虑校友会主任的观点。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Although the director shows us the incoming students' ardor for Grovel College's all-female status, we need to know how other students view such a status, since they may contribute to future application increase. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">虽然主任表明了新生喜爱Grove的全女子教育，我们需要知道其他学生如何看待这一情况，因为这些人可能有助于在未来提高申请数。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If these potential students exhibit great interest in studying at Grovel even without the all-female status, then we should reconsider the director's claim and maybe initiate the coeducational system. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果这些潜在的学生在全女子教育之外也对Grove表现出极大的热情，那么我们就需要再次斟酌主任的言论、并可能会开始实行男女同校。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Likewise, what we also need to know is whether the respondents of the alumnae survey stand representative. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">同样的，我们还需要知道校友会调查的受访者是否具有代表性。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Since the survey may have been biased in terms of its design, we need to ask whether only those who favor the all-female education responded to the survey. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">由于调查可能在设计方面存在偏差，我们需要质疑是否只有那些喜欢全女子教育的人回复了调查。</span></div><div class="tooltip">A positive answer to this questions renders the director's claim less convincing and a negative one lends it more credibility. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果答案是肯定的，主任的主张就不那么可信；而如果答案是否定的，主任的主张就更为可信。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Finally, even if the president's and the director's assertions are sufficiently supported by authentic facts, in order to make a reasonable recommendation concerning the admission system of Grovel College, it is of great significance to take into consideration aspects other than application rate and college identity. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">最后，即使事实充分支持了校长和主任的主张，为了对Grove的录取制度提出合理的建议，考虑申请率和大学认同感之外的方面也是十分重要的。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If extra factors, such as college reputation, matters as much as or more than the aforementioned two factors, then we should give second thought to the two speakers' recommendation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果其余因素，例如学校声誉，和上述两个因素同样重要或更为重要，我们就需要再次考虑两位发言者的建议了。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">To sum up, despite the passionate proposals put forward by the president and director, as well as the respective reason they give, we should defer our conclusion about which is superior until the questions discussed above are carefully examined. <span class="main-inner

appeared in a newsletter offering advice to investors.</p><div class="tooltip">Over 80 percent of the respondents to a recent survey indicated a desire to reduce their intake of foods containing fats and cholesterol, and today low-fat products abound in many food stores. | | Since many of the food products currently marketed by Old Dairy Industries are high in fat and cholesterol, the company's sales are likely to diminish greatly and company profits will no doubt decrease. | | We therefore advise Old Dairy stockholders to sell their shares, and other investors not to purchase stock in this company. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><p></p></blockquote><div class="tooltip">In this newsletter, the author advises Old Dairy stockholders to sell their shares and other investors not to purchase stock in this company. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">To strengthen his/her recommendation, the author cites a recent survey, which indicated more than 80 percent of the respondents' desire to abstain from foods containing fats and cholesterol. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">In addition, the abundance of current low-fat products in many food stores, as well as the great number of Old Dairy's high-fat and high-cholesterol products, are also given to support the predicted diminished sales and decreased profits of the company. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">However, before we reach a final decision about whether or not this advice is reasonable, we first need to raise several questions, and the answers these questions would help us assess this proposal. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><p></p><div class="tooltip">First of all, despite the survey indicating most respondents' desire to refrain from foods containing fats and cholesterol, we need to know whether this desire would directly lead to a decrease in the products of Old Dairy Industries. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">首先，尽管调查显示大多数受访者希望避免摄入含脂肪和胆固醇的食物，我们需要知道这种想法是否真的会减少OD产品的销售额。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Specifically, we need to ask: are the respondents swayed by other factors when selecting foods, such as flavor or price? <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">具体而言，我们需要问：受访者在挑选食物时是否还会受到其他因素如口味或价格的影响？</span></div><div class="tooltip">Also, are the respondents able to distinguish the foods containing fats and cholesterol from those that do not? <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">此外，受访者们是否能够甄别不含脂肪和胆固醇的食物？</span></div><div class="tooltip">If flavor and price do influence the respondents' purchase behavior more than nutritional elements do; or if the respondents cannot tell difference between high-fact and high-cholesterol foods and other foods, a definite decline in high-fat and high-cholesterol foods of Old Dairy would not be guaranteed, and the author's suggestion is undermined. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果口味和价格比营养元素对受访者的影响更大，或受访者无法甄别高脂、高胆固醇的事物，那么我们不能保证OD高脂、高胆固醇产品的销量将会显著降低，而作者的建议也就不那么合理了。</span></div><div class="tooltip">Otherwise, the conclusion of the argument may be verified and the advice is reasonable. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">若答案是肯定的，那么作者的结论将被证实，而他/她的建议也是合理的。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Secondly, even though the author informs us that many food products currently marketed by Old Dairy Industries are high in fat and cholesterol, he/she would benefit from clarifying the question what fraction do these products comprise of all foods produced by Old Dairy Industries? <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">其次，尽管作者告诉我们OD目前销售的许多产品都是高脂、高胆固醇的，阐明这一问题对他/她的论点不无裨益：这些食物在OD生产的所有食品中占多少比例？</span></div><div class="tooltip">Or, more specifically, does Old Dairy Industries also produce low-fat and low-cholesterol foods? <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">更具体而言，OD是否也生产低脂、低胆固醇的食品？</span></div><div class="tooltip">If the answer is yes, then even if the foods containing high fats and cholesterol might suffer from a decline in sales, this decline could probable be offset by an increase in sales of the company's low-fat nad low-cholesterol products. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果回答是肯定的，那么即使高脂、高胆固醇食品的销量会下降，这部分的损失也可以被增长的低脂、低胆固醇食品的销量抵消。</span></div><div class="tooltip">As a result, the company's overall sales would not witness a decrease and neither would their profits. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">因此，公司的整体销售额和利润未必会下降。</span></div><div class="tooltip">However, if Old Dairy Industries relies heavily on sales of high-fat and high-cholesterol foot, then the company is subjected to a significant decrease in both sales and profits. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">然而，如果OD极为依赖于销售高脂、高胆固醇食品，那么公司的销售额和利润就会大幅下降。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">Finally, granted that low-fat and low-cholesterol foods may come to dominate the food market and Old Dairy Industries mainly products foods with high fats and high cholesterol, before deciding whether Old Dairy Industries is worth investing in, we need to know the company's intent. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">最后，即使我们姑且认为低脂、低胆固醇食品将会主导食品市场且OD主要生产高脂、高胆固醇食品，在决定OD是否值得投资前，我们还需要知道公司的打算。</span></div><div class="tooltip">That is to say, we need to ask: will the company change its strategy and main products in the future? <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">也就是说，公司将来会改变它的战略和主打产品吗？</span></div><div class="tooltip">If Old Dairy is flexible in its strategy and can therefore efficiently exchange its products in order to appeal to those favoring low-fat and low-cholesterol foods, we may advise stockholders against selling shares and the persuade other to invest. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果OD采用灵活的战略，能够有效改变它的产品以吸引喜欢低脂、低胆固醇食品的顾客，我们也不会建议股东出售股票并建议其他人进行投资。</span></div><div class="tooltip">If the opposite is true, then we may encourage Old Dairy stockholders to sell their shares, and at the same time deter others investors from purchasing stock in this company. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext">如果事实恰恰相反，那么我们可能会建议OD的股东出售股票，同时让其他投资人打消购买OD股票的想法。</span></div><p></p><p></p><div class="tooltip">To sum up, although the financial market fluctuates greatly, we should not make hasty decisions in response to every erratic market change. <span class="main-inner tooltiptext"></span></div><div class="tooltip">In order to decide whether the recommendation in the argument is reasonable, we need to ask the aforementioned questions and the answers to the questions would contribute to a better evaluation of the proposal. <span class="main-inner
